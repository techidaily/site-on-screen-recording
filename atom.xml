reviewer could thoroughly test and assess it. Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue (Mac) joins the Kinesis keyboard family with its easy-to-use modular design. Better yet, this ergonomic keyboard supports up to three connected devices at a time, allowing you to easily swap between a Mac, iPhone, or iPad with the press of a few hotkeys. With its compact build, the Kinesis Freestyle2 is a welcome addition to any Apple user’s collection, whether they’re at home or on the go, thanks to the excellent battery life of up to 300 plus hours of extended use.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-ergonomic-keyboards-4147386" >The Best Ergonomic Keyboards of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Freestyle2-breaks-the-mold"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Freestyle2-breaks-the-mold" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Freestyle2 breaks the mold"></a><strong>Design and Features: Freestyle2 breaks the mold</strong></h2><p> For people who are tethered to their<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/computer-and-laptop-reviews-4102643" >computers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , ergonomic keyboards are a must. These keyboards tend to be large thanks to the frequently employed swoop design that opens up the keys to provide additional spacing, so fingers feel less cramped, and a wrist-friendly position that prevents<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/game-play-and-streaming-4781449" >repetitive stress injuries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> while typing. These keyboards are typically space hogs, taking up large portions of any surface that they’re placed on, often forcing users to reach further for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-mice-6666207" >mice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This can lead to shoulder injuries in place of wrist injuries—a trade-off no one wants.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/C-YK_WPWu8Ujx1fwDLxvO6Epi-w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kinesis_ErgoKeyboard_1LW4147386_05-adcddc5fc05b415dbcd82396bc0ada77.jpg"                      alt="Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue (Mac)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> The Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue for Mac breaks free of these norms by using a split, modular design that features two keyboard halves, one for each hand, connected via a 9 or 20-inch cable depending upon the chosen model. These pieces were designed with comfort in mind. They may be used separately or connected with a pivot tether at the top of the two halves. This allows you the opportunity to customize your setup and maximize your comfort, whether that’s by placing the halves closer together or further apart.</p><p> The Freestyle2’s minimum size is 15.4 inches in length, but it can extend to a maximum length of 23.5 inches (37.75 inches for the 20-inch model). It uses a standard key layout, so it’s familiar and easy to adjust to, while the low-impact design means that the keys need less pressure to type and are quieter. Additionally, its backside is free of risers letting your wrists sit in a neutral, comfortable position that helps prevent injuries over time.</p><p> Once charged, the battery life can last up to 300-plus hours of regular use.</p><p> Clocking in at 2 pounds, it’s also lightweight which makes it easy to pack. Whether you’re commuting between the home and the office or you’re heading out of town for a vacation, it’s easy to break down and bring anywhere so long as there’s a flat surface to place it during use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115945/19272" target="_top" id="2115945">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115945" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115945/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## **Setup Process: For Apple products only**<p> The Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue arrives with the two keyboard halves, the instructional pamphlet, and a six-foot USB charging cable. Designed for use with iPads,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-and-ios-4781515" >iPhones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/macs-4781332" >Macs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the setup process is quick and easy to complete. First, we flipped the switch on the right-hand side of the keyboard from the off position to the on position. Then, we flipped the keyboard over and pressed the connect button on the backside. We knew it was ready to begin pairing when the lights on the frontside began flashing blue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/XHY6Xe9cdaO1U6Uj0wDY6rROlcA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kinesis_ErgoKeyboard_1LW4147386_04-7fad98b589454e0388ecf48afe425e8c.jpg"                      alt="Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue (Mac)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> From here, we followed the instructions in the provided instructional pamphlet and enabled Bluetooth on our iPad. After about a minute of scanning, the Kinesis KB800MB-BT keyboard appeared as an available device. We simply tapped to connect. From here, it prompted us to input a numeric code and press return. Once we’d done this, setup was complete.</p><h2 id="Features-Efficient-hotkeys-once-you-get-used-to-them"><a href="#Features-Efficient-hotkeys-once-you-get-used-to-them" class="headerlink" title="Features: Efficient hotkeys once you get used to them"></a><strong>Features: Efficient hotkeys once you get used to them</strong></h2><p> Better than its modular design are the easy-to-use hotkeys on the left-hand side of the keyboard. These make it simple to copy, paste, cut, go back or forward in a browser, or even switch between the keyboard’s connected devices smoothly and efficiently. They take a little getting used to but once you get the hang of it using them is a breeze.</p><p> One pet peeve we had with the keyboard design was the Caps lock key. Instead of having a light on the button itself that glows when the function is enabled, this light is placed alongside the Bluetooth connectivity lights on the right-hand side of the keyboard. While this isn’t the end of the world by any means, it’s less intuitive since you need to retrain yourself on where to look to see if it’s enabled. Additionally, you should be aware that leaving this button on or using it frequently can lead to faster battery drain.</p><p> Its split design is comfortable, following the natural arc of your fingers and hands as they rest upon its keys.</p><h2 id="Battery-Plenty-of-juice-so-you’re-never-in-a-bind"><a href="#Battery-Plenty-of-juice-so-you’re-never-in-a-bind" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Plenty of juice so you’re never in a bind"></a><strong>Battery: Plenty of juice so you’re never in a bind</strong></h2><p> The battery life on the Freestyle2 is excellent. It arrives with a partial charge, so it’s important to remember to fully charge it after receiving it. Once charged, the battery life can last up to 300 plus hours of regular use. The Freestyle2 does an excellent job of letting you know when its battery is getting low—battery lights will flash red to indicate when there are about four hours of battery life remaining. This ensures you’re never left hanging.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135403/19272" target="_top" id="2135403">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135403" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135403/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## **Price: Excellent for the features**<p> Full-size ergonomic keyboards tend to retail anywhere from $50 to $200, depending on the features involved. Generally retailing for about $100 on Amazon, the Freestyle2 sits comfortably at the front of this curve. While $100 may seem expensive for a keyboard, consider the features involved. Its travel-friendly build, adjustable setup options, extended battery life, and ability to switch quickly and smoothly between multiple connected devices make it an excellent choice for the features.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vncgu0FEgBJ69UL6H8BjQ2QoGRI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kinesis_ErgoKeyboard_1LW4147386_03-9055476d1d974c8bbe9b1c39d479b300.jpg"                      alt="Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue (Mac)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130871/7443" target="_top" id="2130871">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130871" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130871/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## **Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue vs. Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard**<p> Not all keyboards are created equal, and while the split, modular design offered by the Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue creates wonderful customization options, there’s something to be said for having a full keyboard. For Apple users willing to take a leap into Microsoft products, the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard shines through as an excellent option.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard-review-4780274" >Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> While it may seem odd to lean into Microsoft products for Mac lovers, its split design is comfortable, following the natural arc of your fingers and hands as they rest upon its keys. It also arrives with a mouse and detached numpad, which are some nice perks as the Freestyle2 doesn’t include the numpad, although it is available as an accessory for an additional $40. The Windows key may also be mapped to the command key on the Sculpt. Generally retailing for about $80-$120, the Sculpt is around the same price as the Kinesis.</p><p> Clocking in at 2 pounds, it’s also lightweight which makes it easy to pack.</p><p> One drawback to this device is that the receiver dongle used to pair the Sculpt to your computer is associated with the keyboard at the factory. This is because the keyboard features encryption technology in order to protect your keystrokes. If this dongle is lost, there simply is no replacing it. With this information in mind, this keyboard would do best in an environment where it stays put rather than the Freestyle2 which is much more travel-friendly thanks to its compact nature and Bluetooth pairing capabilities.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An ideal keyboard for Apple users with its compact design, portability, and long-lasting battery.</strong></p><p> The Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue for Mac is a compact, user-friendly ergonomic keyboard that takes comfort and customization to the next level for Apple users thanks to its split, modular design. Its extended battery life of up to 300 plus hours combined with its ability to connect to multiple iOS devices at a time is a game-changer, making it well worth the splurge.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Freestyle2 Blue</li><li>Product Brand  Kinesis</li><li>SKU  KB800HMB-BT</li><li>Price  $99.00</li><li>Weight  2 lbs.</li><li>Warranty  2-year limited warranty on keyboards and accessories</li><li>Range  Approximately 30 feet</li><li>Battery  Rechargeable lithium polymer battery</li><li>Separation  9 or 20-in. versions</li><li>Product Dimensions (9-Inch Version)  Min: 15.375 in.; max: 23.50 in.; distance between F &amp; J keys: min: 3.50 in.; max: 11.50 in.</li><li>Product Dimensions (20-Inch Version)  Min: 15.375 inches; Max: 37.75 inches; Distance between F &amp; J Keys: Min: 3.50 inches; Max: 25.75 inches</li><li>Compatibility  OS X 10.4 and newer, iOS devices</li><li>Key Switch  Peak force: 44 grams; activation force: 35 grams; travel distance: 3.9 mm; switch type: rubber dome, membrane</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-android-playground-the-hottest-wildlife-games/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Android Playground  The Hottest Wildlife Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-best-video-grabbers-for-windows-10-pc/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Best Video Grabbers for Windows 10 PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-essential-strategies-for-capturing-starlit-self-portraits/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Essential Strategies for Capturing Starlit Self-Portraits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-hds-finest-picks-reviewing-top-screen-recorders/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  HD's Finest Picks  Reviewing Top Screen Recorders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-avatar-abstraction-artistry-sculpting-your-playful-image/"><u>[New] In 2024, Avatar Abstraction Artistry  Sculpting Your Playful Image</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-premiere-cameras-to-document-the-next-wave-of-concert-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Premiere Cameras to Document the Next Wave of Concert Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-loves-epic-tales-the-finest-9-weddings-on-youtube-and-vimeo/"><u>[New] Love's Epic Tales  The Finest 9 Weddings on YouTube & Vimeo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-behind-the-scenes-how-much-creators-earn-from-youtube-shorts-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Behind the Scenes  How Much Creators Earn From YouTube Shorts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-fix-iphone-camera-not-focusing-problem/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, How to Fix iPhone Camera Not Focusing Problem</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-circle-construction-techniques-for-the-aspiring-minecraft-artist/"><u>2024 Approved  Circle Construction Techniques for the Aspiring Minecraft Artist</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-free-fast-skype-to-mp3-guide-for-call-recorders/"><u>2024 Approved  Free, Fast  Skype to MP3 Guide for Call Recorders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-innovative-mac-screen-capture-methods-and-software/"><u>2024 Approved  Innovative Mac Screen Capture Methods & Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-multiplatform-iptv-live-streaming/"><u>2024 Approved  Multiplatform IPTV Live Streaming</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-navigating-the-settings-youtube-comments-activation/"><u>2024 Approved  Navigating the Settings  YouTube Comments Activation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-prime-steps-for-capturing-phone-operations/"><u>2024 Approved  Prime Steps for Capturing Phone Operations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-snap-and-save-your-android-no-price-tag/"><u>2024 Approved  Snap & Save Your Android -

How to Record on PS4 with Built-in Tool<p>The easiest way on how to record gameplay on PS4 is by using its default recording tool. However, there are certain limitations that you should be aware of. The default PS4 recording time is 15 minutes, and you can adjust the duration up to 60 minutes only. This means you cannot record a gameplay beyond 60 minutes. If you are good with the limitations, you can follow the simple steps on how to record PS4 gameplay for YouTube and Twitch below.</p><p>Step 1: Turn on your PS4 and press Share button. Go to Sharing and Broadcasts option.</p><p>Step 2: Under Sharing and Broadcasts, go to Length of Video Clip option. Here you are set the recording duration up to 60 minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-recording-duration-ps4.jpg"                      alt="set recording duration ps4"                ></p><p>Step 3: If you want to record your gameplay with your voice, go to Audio Sharing Settings option. Turn on “Include Mic in Video Clip” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/include-microphone-audio-ps4.jpg"                      alt="ps4 record include audio"                ></p><p>Step 4: Start your game and whenever you feel like you need to start recording, press the Share button two times on PS4. The recording will start automatically in the background and as soon as the set duration limit is reached, the recording will stop. However, you can also stop the recording by pressing on Share button twice again.</p><p>Step 5: You can go to the main menu and under Capture Gallery, you will find the recorded video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2120864/26400?prodsku=Mercury" target="_top" id="2120864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2120864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2120864/26400?prodsku=Mercury"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Way 2\. How to Screen Record on PS4 via PC<p>In most cases, your gameplay is likely to go beyond an hour, and hence, PS4 inbuilt screen recorder may not be useful for you. If you want to record your gameplay for more than an hour, you have to use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recorder software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your computer. We recommend Wondershare Filmora to record your gameplay with your audio. There is not going to be any recording time limit, and the video quality is likely to be better than by default screen recorder.</p><p>In fact, you can record at 4K resolution, and you can record with audio as well as webcam. You can edit the video like a pro before publishing the video on various online platforms. However, you have to install a PS4 emulator on your computer to stream your PS4 gameplay.

Instead of opting for its Pro version, you can go for a professional video recorder. We recommend Filmora because you can record as well as edit your video to make it engaging and professional. There is no performance lag even when you record at 4K resolution and it is a better alternative to iTop screen recorder.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-23-budget-friendly-methods-document-webinars-with-no-cost/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  23 Budget-Friendly Methods  Document Webinars with No Cost</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-best-practices-for-obs-based-skype-recording/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Best Practices for OBS-Based Skype Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-beyond-video-chats-webcam-alternatives/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Beyond Video Chats  Webcam Alternatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-capturing-the-moment-leading-tools-to-record-webinars-and-more/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Capturing the Moment -

The software has become very popular within the corporate culture because it provides a simple and efficient way to hold online meetings and record them at the same time. In case you were wondering how you can record videos in Adobe Connect, you’ve come to the right place because in this article we are going to take you through each step of the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983539">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983539.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983539">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983539.png"                      style="border: none;

You can pause the recording or click on the Stop button if the web conference is over. After the video recording session, you’ll be able to change the URL’s title, and if you would like to edit the video directly from the Adobe Connect you can do so by clicking on the Edit Video button.</p><h2 id="How-to-Edit-Videos-with-Adobe-Connect"><a href="#How-to-Edit-Videos-with-Adobe-Connect" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit Videos with Adobe Connect"></a>How to Edit Videos with Adobe Connect</h2><p>Editing videos in Adobe Connect will require you to have the Host permission, but if you are the author of the video you’ll be granted the permission automatically. The link you’ve created by recording the web conference or a training doesn’t change if you edit a video, which means that you can edit a single video in Adobe Connect as many times as you want.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Launch-the-video-editor"><a href="#Step-1-Launch-the-video-editor" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 - Launch the video editor"></a>Step 1 - Launch the video editor</h4><p>When the video recording session is over, you should click on the Meeting or Training option on the software’s homepage. Proceed to select the classroom or the meeting that contains the video you just recorded. Afterward, you should click on the Recordings option, and then select the Edit Recording feature in the Actions pop-up menu.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Editing-the-video"><a href="#Step-2-Editing-the-video" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 - Editing the video"></a>Step 2 - Editing the video</h4><p>The software’s video editor will appear on the screen, and you’ll be able to see the toolbar that enables you to play the video or cut the unwanted parts of the file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-connect-edit-video.jpg"                      alt=" Adobe Connect Record Meeting "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123479/16836" target="_top" id="2123479">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2123479" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123479/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->Click on the Play button to preview the video or use the progress marker to jump to a desired spot in the video. You can also use the progress marker to designate the place in the video where you want to make a cut, and then simply click on the Cut icon that looks like a pair of scissors. The Adobe Connect's video editor also enables you to control the volume level by clicking on the audio icon on the right side of the editor's toolbar.<p>If you make a mistake during the video editing process, you can use the Undo button to correct it. When you remove all the unwanted parts of the video, click on the Save button to conclude the video editing session.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>Adobe Connect is one of the best software products for the creation of eLearning content and video presentations currently available on the market. Its recording and video editing features are powerful enough to enable the software’s users to capture high-quality footage of web conferences and online training, but Adobe Connect lacks advanced features high-end professionals use to create their content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

You can record your screen perfectly but the only issue is that QuickTime player screen recording audio feature is not available. That does not mean you cannot record screen as well as audio with QuickTime. Here are the steps on QuickTime how to record screen with sound.</p><p>Step 1: You will have to install a free extension called SoundFlower so that you can record audio through QuickTime along with recording the screen. Therefore, download <a class="link"   href="https://soundflower.en.softonic.com/mac" >SoundFlower <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> free extension software. The main job of SoundFlower is to channel the audio playing from one application to another. Install SoundFlower application on your Mac from the downloaded file.</p><p>Step 2: Once you have installed SoundFlower on your Mac, restart your computer. This will ensure that there is no issue with QuickTime screen recording with sound.</p><p>Step 3: Go to Apple menu and open System Preferences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/system-preferences.jpg"                      alt="system preferences"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/2139563/4704" target="_top" id="2139563">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-2139563" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/2139563/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->Step 4: Go to Sound tab and from Sound Output, select SoundFlower(2ch) option.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Instagram-Live-From-OBS-Capture"><a href="#Instagram-Live-From-OBS-Capture" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Live From OBS Capture"></a>Instagram Live From OBS Capture</h2><p>Instagram is steadily becoming a great video content platform against the popular belief that it is merely a photo posting platform. In fact, it has become an equally popular platform among creators and brands as YouTube. That is why creators are willing to upload creative videos and go for live streaming to engage the audiences and get brand deals. You should live stream to Instagram from OBS Studio if you want to stream from your computer.</p><p>Instagram is primarily a mobile app and Instagrammers live stream from their smartphones. However, just like YouTube, you can live stream from your computer if the popular Instagrammers are doing these days. You need OBS Studio which is available for free and it is compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux. In this article, we will illustrate how to use OBS to Instagram live in simple steps.</p><h5 id="Filmora-Audio-Recorder"><a href="#Filmora-Audio-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Audio Recorder"></a>Filmora Audio Recorder</h5><p>Record computer system audio</p><p>Capture microphone audio</p><p>Customize recording volume</p><p>Record screen and webcam as well</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Setup-OBS-Studio"><a href="#Part-1-Setup-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Setup OBS Studio"></a>Part 1. Setup OBS Studio</h2><p>OBS Studio is a live video stream software platform for computer users. You can live stream on almost any video streaming platform as long as you have the stream URL and stream key. On the other hand, Instagram only allows Instagram Live feature from its app. Therefore, you need a third-party app to obtain the stream URL and stream key so that you can connect OBS Studio with Instagram for live stream.</p><p>There are various third-party apps available to setup OBS Instagram live stream session. We recommend Streamon The application is also available for Windows, Mac and Linux users, just like OBS Studio. Before getting started, you should have the following ready.</p><ul><li>An Instagram account where you want to live stream from your computer.</li><li>Live streaming gadgets such as webcam, external microphone, lights as per your requirements.</li><li>Download and install Streamon as per your operating system.</li><li>Download and install OBS Studio on your computer.</li></ul><p>Here are the steps you have to take to setup OBS Instagram link to start live streaming.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS Studio on your computer.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Profile&gt; New and name it as “OBS Studio Instagram live“.

It has a **6-element glass lens** and delivers **1080p at an admirable 30 FPS**. It also has **automatic low-light correction**, which is so important to us! The result is precise and dependable streaming quality, without the need for an expensive lighting setup.<p>Working with OBS Studio, the Ontop+ is designed to optimise your videos for YouTube and <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Twitch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The wide-angle view also gives you impressive <strong>80-degree panoramic views</strong>.</p><p>Now, it is often assumed that audio is something which lets even the most expensive webcams down. Ontop+ wanted to challenge this assumption and make a webcam with fantastic audio quality. With <strong>built-in dual digital noise-cancellation microphones</strong>, Ontop+ claim their camera will work in all environments. Unfortunately, they haven’t quite lived up to the hype and the audio is occasionally patchy. But, at just under $50 we are willing to overlook some of the Ontop+’s limitations to give it our seal of approval.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Wide-angle viewing lens</li><li>Optimised for YouTube and Twitch</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>Average Amazon rating</li></ul><h4 id="2-Logitech-BRIO"><a href="#2-Logitech-BRIO" class="headerlink" title="2.

It also supports <strong>Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR</strong> which gives it exceptional performance regardless of the light conditions. Plus, you can choose between a 65-degree, 78-degree, and a 90-degree field of vision, privacy shade and a flexible mount.</p><p>For professional streamers, this is a fantastic investment piece. However, there is a catch. To stream at 4K, you’ll need to connect the Brio to a USB 3.0 port on a computer running on Intel’s seventh generation Kaby Lake processors.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>4K Ultra HD recording</li><li>Logitech RightLight 3 with HDR</li><li>Fantastic audio</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Price</li><li>Compatibility</li></ul><h4 id="3-Razer-Kiyo"><a href="#3-Razer-Kiyo" class="headerlink" title="3.

The **ring-light camera** is a new feature, with twelve white LED lights surrounding the lens. Plus, the Razer Kiyo lets you adjust the brightness of the ring-light camera, with **12 different brightness settings,** so that you can always get the most flattering light. Although the Kiyo doesn’t come with much else. There’s no facial enhancement technology or background replacement.<p>What it does excel at is creating a vivid stream with high resolution. It is capable of shooting <strong>1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)</strong> and <strong>1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD)</strong> like a lot of its competitors. But we are convinced gamers will love the great lighting features that are unique to this style of streaming webcam. The camera was created after consultation with Twitch streamers and it also comes with built-in support for Xsplit and Open Broadcaster Software.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Built-in Ring Light</li><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Built for Twitch streamers</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio quality</li><li>No additional features</li><li>Cost</li></ul><h4 id="4-AUKEY-FHD-Webcam"><a href="#4-AUKEY-FHD-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="4.

With **1080p full HD video at 30 FPS**, on a **2-megapixel base** and **built-in stereo microphones**, this webcam keeps up with its main competitors and delivers a high-resolution image.<p>What we love about it though is its ease of use. This camera is compatible with Windows XP, Mac OS 10.6 and Android 5.0 or higher. It has <strong>no additional software to install</strong>, just plug it into a USB port and start streaming. It is also very portable and light.</p><p>Although, the lighting might be an issue unless you have a good ambience when you stream. The Aukey also does not autofocus as well as other cameras on this list. But with a discount on Amazon, this is an excellent camera for beginners.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>1080p HD streaming</li><li>Cost</li><li>Ease of use</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>No lighting correction features</li><li>No 60 FPS streaming</li></ul><h4 id="5-Razer-Stargazer"><a href="#5-Razer-Stargazer" class="headerlink" title="5. Razer Stargazer"></a>5. Razer Stargazer</h4><p>The Razer Stargazer is the best webcam at effortless background removal. It is the only external webcam with an <strong>Intel RealSense 3D camera</strong>, state of the art depth-sensing technology allows you to give more viewing space to the game and gives your viewers a more engaging experience.</p><p>However, the <a class="link"   href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/intel-realsense-guide,news-20286.html?_ga=2.47407079.1755955212.1524468879-954383139.1524153897" >Intel RealSense camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> limits the camera’s compatibility to Windows 10 computers with sixth-generation or later Intel Core CPUs. This is a minimum specification that non-RealSense webcams don’t require.</p><p>Like most of its competitors the Stargazer streams <strong>1,920 x 1,080 at 30 FPS (Full HD)</strong> and <strong>1,280 x 720 at 60 FPS (HD).</strong> With the Stargazer, you will have good screen resolution, but you will not be the sharpest-looking streamer on platforms like Twitch. Occasionally, the Kiyo will struggle to focus in low-light settings, but it does have <strong>fantastic colour accuracy</strong>. What it does have over its competitors though is audio. The Stargazer wins out here because it’s <strong>fantastic at filtering out ambient noise</strong>.</p><p>If you don’t have the room or money for a physical green screen or an external mic but want effortless and professional performance the Razer Stargazer is the webcam for you, with prices starting at <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Stargazer-Depth-Sensing-Webcam-1080P/dp/B01GE9QM5M" >only $150 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Incredible background removal technology</li><li>Great audio</li><li>Cost</li></ul><p><strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>Not as good video quality as some of its competitors</li><li>Not compatible with older generation computers</li></ul><p>Streamers on platforms such as Twitch, seem to be choosing Logitech cameras most often. However, although the BRIO delivers unbeatable performance for gaming, there are now other brands challenging Logitech’s gaming supremacy. Razer has two innovative cameras on this list. The Kiyo has cutting-edge lighting technology and the Stargazer, with Intel RealSense, has the best background removal technology we have seen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><p>For those with the budget to invest in a serious piece of equipment, we would recommend the BRIO and the Stargazer, depending upon your computer’s processor.

You can adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpen, and other parameters to enhance the video quality.</p><p>Moreover, you can use hotkeys to operate the software smoothly, and the user interface is quite simple and easy to operate.</p><h2 id="3-In-depth-Review"><a href="#3-In-depth-Review" class="headerlink" title="3. In-depth Review"></a>3. In-depth Review</h2><p>Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.</p><p>Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders. Hence, it does not put much pressure on CPU resource. Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.</p><p>Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.</p><p>Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p><p>Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother. However, it lacks editing options post-recording so that you could take the video to the next level.</p><h2 id="4-Best-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4.

A number of great development studios were closing, and even mainstream series like Need for Speed struggled to maintain their original popularity.</p><p>If you are a racing fan, then there is good news for you. Things are a lot better today as compared to the past. Several racing titles have been introduced over the years, like Forza Horizon, Assetto Corsa, iRacing, etc. We have seen several open-world racing games getting immense popularity among gamers. The simulation racing genre is more competitive than ever today. In July 2015, EA acquired Codemasters for a staggering $1.2 billion, illustrating how highly racing games have been valued for the last few years.</p><p>This article will present our top picks of the best sim racing games you can play right now. Most of these games are modern because this genre is continuously improving. But, we won’t be skipping those classic titles that are still popular among gamers and as good as modern ones. Our primary focus here will be to cover those games that are easy to find and play on the majority of the hardware. So without wasting any time, let’s get to our main topic.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139121/17108" target="_top" id="2139121">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139121" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139121/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## THE BEST SIM RACING GAMES<h3 id="1-Dirt-Rally-2-0"><a href="#1-Dirt-Rally-2-0" class="headerlink" title="1.Dirt Rally 2.0"></a>1.Dirt Rally 2.0</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dirt-rally-poster.jpg"                      alt="dirt-rally-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983471">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983471.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983471">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983471.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983471%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983471/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->If you are looking for the best off-road racing simulation gamers, then dirt rally 2.0 stands on the top of the list. There has probably never been anything better. Despite its unbalanced package, this car offers outstanding handling and a driving experience as gripping as anything else in this class.

In addition to that, it encapsulates some of the most exciting aspects of motorsport. As you work your way through the ranks, you will experience the same camaraderie and excitement as the real deal - and, yes, crushing disappointment too. It’s undeniable that some aspects of Iracing are becoming a bit stale - and there are certainly more realistic-looking sims out there - but with ten years of experience comes a level of competency you won’t find anywhere else.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The technology and features it offers are superior to those of its competitors.</li><li>The tracks are very authentic, realistic, and accurate.</li><li>A huge selection of cars is available.

Assetto Corsa has seen better days, but it can still be an awesome driving sim with a few mods, and Competizione is getting better as it reaches iRacing as a pure racing sim. As far as GT racing is concerned, it is probably the healthiest and most diverse form of motorsports right now.</p><p>Assetto Corsa also has a number of useful force feedback options that will let you experience driving a car without having to feel it. You are likely to have the most difficulty getting used to a PC when you start.

Cars and tracks are abundant here, especially if you purchase the season pass along with numerous car packs.<p>Physicists have made these improvements to accommodate the physics engine, like in Assetto Corsa. Driving a car is fun because they are responsive and fun, but I always have difficulties connecting with them. The wide range of vehicles here, from two-stroke karts to four-wheel-drive rally vehicles, makes it all feel the same, which is a problem.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The physics is much better than the competition.</li><li>Classic and new cars are available.</li><li>Race tracks of even better quality.</li><li>Track and weather conditions that are dynamic.</li><li>The difficulty level can be adjusted very easily.</li><li>The PC version of this game has amazing VR.</li></ul><h3 id="5-rFactor-2"><a href="#5-rFactor-2" class="headerlink" title="5.rFactor 2"></a>5.rFactor 2</h3><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rfactor2-poster.png"                      alt="rfactor2-poster"                ></p><p>We go way, way back with rFactor. Its core physics engine was used to power older iconic games, like F1 Challenge 2002. Ad-hoc online leagues and modified mods were my only choice back then. The list of licensed cars and tracks in rFactor 2 is now extensive (and is still growing), and it even includes some of the most competitive online racing series around.</p><p>RFactor 2 is the one game that gets seriously out of everything I’ve listed so far. The game doesn’t come with a half-dozen offline career modes or a complex licensing system that unlocks cars. There’s a menu where you choose where to race, which car to drive, and then you’re off. Offline racing is certainly possible, and the artificially intelligent competition will provide a good challenge, but the most frightful competition is usually to be found online – including the likes of Max Verstappen.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The physics of this game is the most complex among all sim racing games.</li><li>The handling of cars is way better.</li><li>Different weather and day and night conditions of the game make it much more appealing.</li><li>You can choose from some really high-quality mods with great mod support.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123479/16836" target="_top" id="2123479">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2123479" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123479/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Conclusion<p>Sim racing is one of the most favorite sub-genre of racing lovers. So, we have presented you with a list of some of the best sim racing games that are available in the market right now. All these games work on almost the same physics. The only difference is between graphics, cars, maps, tracks, mods, and other technicalities. All games have their own pros and cons. Some offer the fastest cars while others offer better handling. It all comes down to user choice and preferences.

Cars and tracks are abundant here, especially if you purchase the season pass along with numerous car packs.<p>Physicists have made these improvements to accommodate the physics engine, like in Assetto Corsa. Driving a car is fun because they are responsive and fun, but I always have difficulties connecting with them.

Its core physics engine was used to power older iconic games, like F1 Challenge 2002\. Ad-hoc online leagues and modified mods were my only choice back then. The list of licensed cars and tracks in rFactor 2 is now extensive (and is still growing), and it even includes some of the most competitive online racing series around.<p>RFactor 2 is the one game that gets seriously out of everything I’ve listed so far. The game doesn’t come with a half-dozen offline career modes or a complex licensing system that unlocks cars. There’s a menu where you choose where to race, which car to drive, and then you’re off. Offline racing is certainly possible, and the artificially intelligent competition will provide a good challenge, but the most frightful competition is usually to be found online – including the likes of Max Verstappen.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li>The physics of this game is the most complex among all sim racing games.</li><li>The handling of cars is way better.</li><li>Different weather and day and night conditions of the game make it much more appealing.</li><li>You can choose from some really high-quality mods with great mod support.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135395/19272" target="_top" id="2135395">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135395" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135395/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Conclusion<p>Sim racing is one of the most favorite sub-genre of racing lovers. So, we have presented you with a list of some of the best sim racing games that are available in the market right now. All these games work on almost the same physics. The only difference is between graphics, cars, maps, tracks, mods, and other technicalities. All games have their own pros and cons. Some offer the fastest cars while others offer better handling. It all comes down to user choice and preferences. If you are new to the sim racing environment, you can try all these titles and then decide which one suits you the best.</p><p><a href="#">Try It Free</a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a

It organizes the musical audio and video files by copying them to Apple products such as iPad, iPod, and iPhone. Well, most of us modern generation want to know of other ways to record iTunes videos through different ways.

In September 2021, PlayStation showcased a packed trailer with Daddy Kratos, foes along the Atreus. The trailer has been trending since the time it was released. Even the first look of the trailer is serving us with too much suspense. The addition of new characters, game details, and plot everything is so on point. Want to know more! Let’s jump to the further details.<h2 id="God-of-war-Ragnarok-Release-Date"><a href="#God-of-war-Ragnarok-Release-Date" class="headerlink" title="God of war Ragnarok: Release Date"></a><strong>God of war Ragnarok: Release Date</strong></h2><p>Desperate to know about the God of war Ragnarok Release Date!

After watching the trailer of God of war Ragnarok, our expectations are pretty high. The game is the ninth entry within the sequel of 2018’s jaw-dropping God of war. God of war was all about ancient Greece to Scandinavia, Kratos against the monsters, and Gods of Norse Mythology. The trailer gave us the idea to expect a more confident and older Atreus, and the next story is going to be based on his giant genes.</p><p>Now, the father and son are the new face of Ragnarok, the Norse version of disaster. Their new journey will be about facing the old enemies from God of War, Freya. New enemies include Thor and Kratos with his son’s rebellious nature. His son is the only one with knowledge about Atreus. The overall story will be based on a total of Nine Realms. Before this, God of War took place in six realms. The latest realms will be Asgard, Svartalfheim, and Vanaheim, along with the previous ones.</p><p>Furthermore, the trailer clarifies that we will see some new characters like Angrboa, who will be one of the last giants in the gameplay. Have you noticed a big guy in the trailer? He is Tyr, the son of Odin and half-brother of Baldur and Thor. But, the son is imprisoned by the father, isn’t it an incredible thrill? If you focus more on the PS5 showcase, you will realize it’s a brief and cryptic teaser. The overall trailer revolves more around the arrival of Ragnarok. In the excitement of “Ragnarok is coming,” most of us are not noticing the game footage. For us, it’s a confirmation of suspense. That background warning of Kratos is not less than an alarm for Atreus and viewers that we should “get ready.” At the end of God of War, we noticed that Kratos’s wife was another mystery; she was the Giant Laufey. This clearly shows that Atreus is Half God and as well as Half-Giant. He has a different name, i.e., Loki. Yes, Loki, the trickster of the Norse Mythology.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/god-of-war-ragnarok-poster3.jpg"                      alt="god-of-war-ragnarok-poster3"                ></p><p>Now, we expect that Ragnarok will explore Faye’s past and the reason she kept it secret. Hopefully, Atreus will get the shape-changing abilities that Loki is currently notorious for. So, Atreus is not just going to be about standing on the sidelines and firing arrows at enemies.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137225/26400" target="_top" id="2137225">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137225" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137225/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## **God of War Ragnarok is not PS5 exclusive**<p>Along with the God of war Ragnarok Release Date, there is news that the game will not be a PS5 exclusive.
