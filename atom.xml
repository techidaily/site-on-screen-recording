    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="BackUpMasters-Expert-Verdict"><a href="#BackUpMasters-Expert-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="BackUpMasters Expert Verdict"></a>BackUpMasters Expert Verdict</h2><p>EaseUS RecExperts is a screen recording program for Windows that allows users to capture a complete screen or a select area of it, as well as record narrator voice or system noises and improve the overall quality of the individual clip. Within a PC, the system may be utilized to create professional-looking films. Camera video recording is supported by EaseUS RecExperts, allowing users to shoot movies inside the webcam or as an overlay, allowing for higher levels of involvement. You may record the whole screen, a specific region, or even a locked window with EaseUS RecExperts. Additionally, while recording, you may annotate your screen, label an area, and do other editing activities. You can rapidly export or distribute your recording to various platforms, depending on your preferences.</p><p>EaseUS RecExperts is a multi-purpose but simple-to-use Windows screen recorder that allows you to record and capture everything on your computer’s screen. Thanks to its simple and well-organized interface, you can get started quickly. You may record your screen, audio, and camera independently or all at once. In addition, the game recording option enables you to record your games in whatever way you desire. Annotation, cutting, watermark insertion, and other sophisticated editing tools are included in the program. The recordings may be exported in a variety of file formats, including MP4, AVI, and WMV. They may even upload the created video to YouTube immediately. Noise reduction and audio enhancement are also included in the software’s capabilities. It comes with its game recording mode, capable of capturing popular 2D&#x2F;3D games in 4K UHD quality. Users may use the built-in task planner to complete their recording tasks on time and in an automatic manner.</p><h2 id="1-Price-and-Tech-Specifications"><a href="#1-Price-and-Tech-Specifications" class="headerlink" title="1. Price and Tech Specifications"></a>1. Price and Tech Specifications</h2><p>EaseUS RecExperts cost $11.97 a month, $23.97 a year, or $69.95 for the rest of your life. A single license for one machine is included in this price. It’s worth noting that you can test out the program for free. The trial version restricts you to two-minute recordings and adds a watermark to your movies.</p><p>Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and Mac OS are all supported by EaseUS RecExperts. Initially, EaseUS Screen Recorder was only available for Windows, but a Mac OS version was eventually published. The program will be installed as a standalone app on your system disk. There are no further add-ons required. When recording games, RecExperts also allows you to alter the frame rate up to 60 frames per second. RecExperts is starting to look like a first-class application for all kinds of on-screen recording requirements, with the ability to output to 10+ commonly used recording formats (including MP4, MOV, and MP3), the ability to make GIFs directly from screen captures, and the ability to automatically stop and split recordings based on time or file size limits.</p><h2 id="2-How-to-Use-RecExperts"><a href="#2-How-to-Use-RecExperts" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Use RecExperts"></a>2. How to Use RecExperts</h2><p>EaseUS RecExperts is a premium screen recording software for Windows and Mac OS created by EaseUS.com. It’s a multi-purpose screen recorder that can do both screen recording and Webcam recording. RecExperts may also record full-screen or a specific part of the screen. The free trial version of RecExperts can be downloaded fast and conveniently from the EaseUS website, and the installation can be started right away.</p><p>Step 1: Launch EaseUS RecExperts</p><p>As can be seen in the screenshot below, the first function that is pre-selected for us when we launch the RecExperts program is the one that is necessary for capturing the complete default computer display. We have simple access to all of the software’s key functionalities as well as the main settings menu for modifying, among other things, the default file formats utilized, from this main program window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/easeus-recexperts.jpg"                      alt="easeus recexperts"                ></p><p>Step 2: Setup the Recording</p><p>For improved content distribution, you may record the single Webcam or use the Webcam as an overlay on a movie. With simplicity, you may pick full-screen recording, a specific portion of the screen, or a single window. Simply pressing the orange “REC” button will start the recording process; the main program windows will vanish at this point, being replaced by a smaller control window, as seen below:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-setup-the-recording.jpg"                      alt="setup the recording"                ></p><p>Step 3: Finish&#x2F;Save Recording</p><p>We may finish the recording by clicking the red “stop” button after the screen recording is complete (which will, by default, include any sound outputted by the device during this process). When the recording is finished and the stop button is pushed, the RecExperts program will open the freshly recorded clip in the RecExperts editing suite, where we may continue to work with the material:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-recoring.jpg"                      alt="save recording"                ></p><h2 id="3-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#3-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="3. Pros and Cons"></a>3. Pros and Cons</h2><p>EaseUS RecExperts is one of the finest screen recorders available whether you’re producing webinars or need to record movies on your PC. This powerful program lets you capture a portion of your screen, overlay video from a camera, and record audio on top of it all. RecExperts supports 4K recording and includes several useful tools to enhance the impact of your films.</p><p>**<strong>Pros:</strong></p><ul><li>Audio and video from the webcam are captured.</li><li>An automated recording is supported.</li><li>Video quality, frame rate, and audio bitrate may all be adjusted.</li><li>GPU-assisted hardware acceleration is supported.</li><li>(Basic) video editing tools built-in</li><li>The picture formats BMP, JPG, PNG, GIF, and TIFF are all supported by EaseUS Screen Recorder.</li><li>Recordings may be used to extract screenshots or audio samples.</li><li>Support for ten distinct output file types is complete.</li><li>EaseUS RecExperts supports video formats MP4, WMV, AVI, MOV, FLV, and ASF, as well as audio formats MP3.</li></ul><p>**<strong>Cons:</strong></p><ul><li>The editing options are limited.</li><li>A little bit pricey</li></ul><h2 id="4-Alternative-to-RecExperts"><a href="#4-Alternative-to-RecExperts" class="headerlink" title="4.

Commonly screencasts are created by recording a single monitor, but some screen recording software products allow their users to capture footage from two different displays simultaneously.</p><p>If you would like to capture footage from multiple monitors, but you are not sure how, you’ve come to the right place, because in this article we are going to show you how to record two monitors at the same time using the OBS Studio and Camtasia screen recording software.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                > Secure Download</p><h2 id="How-to-Record-Multiple-Monitors-1"><a href="#How-to-Record-Multiple-Monitors-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Record Multiple Monitors"></a>How to Record Multiple Monitors</h2><p>The first step towards setting up a screencasting session with multiple displays is to make sure that the monitors are properly connected to your laptop or desktop computer. Each external monitor will display identical images when turned on, but in order to move software windows between the two screens, you’ll have to enable the ‘Extend These Displays’ option. The actual steps you’ll need to take may vary, depending on the computer and the OS you are using, and we are going to show you how to extend displays on Windows 8 or later.</p><p>Head over to the Start Menu, and open the Control Panel. Select the ‘Adjust Screen Resolution’ option in the Appearance and Personalization menu, and then click on the Multiple Displays drop-down menu. Pick the ‘Extend These Displays’ option from the list and proceed to save the changes by clicking on the OK button.</p><h3 id="Recording-Multiple-Monitors-With-OBS-Studio"><a href="#Recording-Multiple-Monitors-With-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Recording Multiple Monitors With OBS Studio"></a>Recording Multiple Monitors With OBS Studio</h3><p>Widely accepted as one of the best open-source broadcasting and screen recording software ever created, OBS Studio also enables its users to record multiple screens simultaneously. The plug-in for the OBS called Simple Scene Switcher that detects on which monitor the mouse cursor is and that automatically switches between two monitors as you drag a mouse is a great option if you don’t want to record multiple displays at the same time. The plug-in lets you switch between windows without disrupting the flow of the video, which makes it particularly useful for LoL players and in numerous other situations. Here’s how you can record multiple monitors with OBS.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Adding-a-Second-Display"><a href="#Step-1-Adding-a-Second-Display" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 - Adding a Second Display"></a>Step 1 - Adding a Second Display</h4><p>Once you launch the software, you should use the right-click to access the software’s drop-down menu. Locate the Add feature and select the Display Capture option. Create&#x2F;Select Source window will pop-up, hit OK and once the Properties window appears on screen you should select your second monitor form the Display drop-down list. A new screen will emerge on the screen, and you can simply drag it to reposition it where you want.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Adjusting-the-Resolution"><a href="#Step-2-Adjusting-the-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 - Adjusting the Resolution"></a>Step 2 - Adjusting the Resolution</h4><p>Go to OBS Studio’s main window and click on the Settings button in the lower right corner of the window. Select the Video option from the Settings menu, and then expand the Base (Canvas) Resolution bar.</p><p>Sum up the two values of the wider sides of the screens and insert the value you get into the Base Resolution bar. For example, if one monitor has a 1366X768 resolution and the second one has a 1024X768 resolution, you should add 1024 to the 1366 and insert the resulting value (2390) as the wide resolution value in Base Resolution Bar.</p><p>Save the changes you’ve made, and then drag the screens to arrange them. You can start recording multiple monitors with OBS Studio by clicking on the Start Recording button.</p><h3 id="Capturing-Multiple-Monitor-Displays-with-Camtasia"><a href="#Capturing-Multiple-Monitor-Displays-with-Camtasia" class="headerlink" title="Capturing Multiple Monitor Displays with Camtasia"></a>Capturing Multiple Monitor Displays with Camtasia</h3><p>Selecting more than one monitor from the Camtasia’s Fullscreen settings is unfortunately not possible, but the Custom recording settings option allows you to capture footage from two different displays. You’ll need to make sure that both monitors are properly aligned and the that Extend These Displays feature is selected. Here’s how you record multiple monitors with Camtasia.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Setting-up-the-Screen-Recording-Session-on-Multiple-Monitors"><a href="#Step-1-Setting-up-the-Screen-Recording-Session-on-Multiple-Monitors" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 - Setting up the Screen Recording Session on Multiple Monitors"></a>Step 1 - Setting up the Screen Recording Session on Multiple Monitors</h4><p>Click on the Custom drop-down menu in Camtasia’s main window., and then click on the Select area to record option and proceed to designate the area of the multiple screens you want to record. You can accomplish this by clicking the left mouse button and dragging the boundary handles. Making the adjustments to the initial selections is also possible, even after you let go of the mouse key, but not during the screen recording session.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Recording-and-Editing-the-Video"><a href="#Step-2-Recording-and-Editing-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 - Recording and Editing the Video"></a>Step 2 - Recording and Editing the Video</h4><p>Camtasia allows you to capture system audio, record sound from an external microphone, as well as to adjust the frame rate or the video resolution of the screen recording you are making. Hit the Record button when you are ready to start capturing footage from multiple monitors. The file you’ve created will be displayed in the software’s video editing mode, after the screencasting session is over, so you can remove unwanted parts of the video or add visual and text effects to your video.</p><h4 id="Tips-for-Recording-Multiple-Monitors"><a href="#Tips-for-Recording-Multiple-Monitors" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Recording Multiple Monitors"></a>Tips for Recording Multiple Monitors</h4><p>Creating <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recordings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in high resolutions will use up a lot of the computer’s RAM memory, which can destabilize Camtasia’s video editor and cause it to crash. What’s more, if your computer doesn’t have a good graphics card, a lot of RAM memory and a great processor, the multiple monitor screen recordings may have a lag or even dropped frames. That’s the reason why you should make sure that your computer configuration is capable of capturing smooth screen recordings from multiple monitors, before starting your first screencasting session with multiple monitors.</p><p>In case that you want to record your secondary monitor, we recommend you to try <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><ul><li>Able to record Primary and Secondary Display</li><li>Able to Record Desktop Screen And Webcam Simultaneously</li><li>Able to Record Computer Audio And Voice Over</li><li>Splendid Annotations, Cursor Effects and Editing Features</li></ul><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-essential-list-the-10-free-android-and-iphone-video-chat-apps/"><u>[New] Essential List  The 10 Free, Android & iPhone Video Chat Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-iphoneipad-video-and-image-archive/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate iPhone/iPad Video & Image Archive</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-choreographed-combat-selecting-superior-fighting-titles/"><u>In 2024, Choreographed Combat  Selecting Superior Fighting Titles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-make-every-gaming-moment-count-top-5-ways-to-record-in-minecraft-on-a-mac/"><u>In 2024, Make Every Gaming Moment Count  Top 5 Ways to Record in Minecraft on a Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-unravel-enigmas-your-guide-to-elite-escape-spaces-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unravel Enigmas  Your Guide to Elite Escape Spaces for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/prime-screen-grabs-for-film-enthusiasts/"><u>Prime Screen Grabs for Film Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-maximizing-ipad-audio-record-best-tips-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Maximizing iPad Audio Record  Best Tips for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-the-artisans-guide-to-essential-tools-and-techniques-in-tiktok/"><u>[New] The Artisan's Guide to Essential Tools and Techniques in TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/4-solutions-to-fix-unfortunately-your-app-has-stopped-error-on-poco-c51-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>4 Solutions to Fix Unfortunately Your App Has Stopped Error on Poco C51 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/highlighting-elite-gif-software-on-apple-iphones-for-2024/"><u>Highlighting Elite GIF Software on Apple iPhones for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-top-8-internet-accessible-free-audio-recorders-of-the-year-2024/"><u>The Ultimate Guide Top 8 Internet Accessible Free Audio Recorders of the Year 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-pinnaclepix-z7-pro-elevate-your-photos-dimensions/"><u>2024 Approved  PinnaclePix Z7 Pro  Elevate Your Photo's Dimensions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/the-magnificent-art-of-pokemon-go-streaming-on-nokia-c32-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>The Magnificent Art of Pokemon Go Streaming On Nokia C32?

All you have to do is double-click on the Xbox button and the screenshot will be captured. A sidebar will appear on the screen asking you if you want to take a screenshot or record the last 30 seconds of the gameplay. Just hit the Y button to save the screenshot. A dialog box will appear on the screen informing you that the screenshot has been saved successfully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/xbox-screenshot.jpg"                      alt="Xbox Screenshot"                ></p><p>An increasing number of video games for Xbox One can be played in 4K resolution, but in order to play a game in a 4K resolution, you must have a 4K TV set. Moreover, the 4K and HDR capabilities your TV must be enabled before you start playing an Xbox One game in 4K. Taking a 4K screenshot on Xbox One requires you to adjust the capturing settings.</p><p>Press the Xbox button on the controller, and locate the System menu. Select the Settings option from the System menu and then click on the Preferences submenu. Navigate to the Broadcast&amp;Capture option and when the new menu appears on the screen, click on the Game clip resolution and select one of the available 4K settings.</p><p>Keep in mind that 4K screenshots are significantly larger in size than those in HD or any other resolution so if you would like to share a screenshot on social media you’ll first have to download it to your Windows 10 PC and resize it.

Both of them enable you to take screenshots using voice commands. If your Xbox One has the Kinect motion sensor, you should issue the ‘Xbox take a screenshot’ command. Viewing the screenshot immediately after it was taken, requires you to say ‘Xbox open that’ and the screenshot will pop up on the screen or you can just push and hold the Xbox button on the controller.</p><p>You can say ‘ Hey <em>Cortana, take a screenshot’</em> if your Xbox One features a Cortana motion sensor. However, in order to be able to issue voice commands, you must first activate this option. Head over to the Xbox One’s Settings menu and locate the All Settings option. Click on System and switch on the AI Companion feature.</p><p>It is important to say the command clearly so the AI can understand what you are trying to do, and for that reason, you should try to avoid capturing screenshots or recording videos via voice commands in noisy rooms.</p><h2 id="How-to-Manage-and-Share-Screenshots-on-Xbox-One"><a href="#How-to-Manage-and-Share-Screenshots-on-Xbox-One" class="headerlink" title="How to Manage and Share Screenshots on Xbox One?"></a>How to Manage and Share Screenshots on Xbox One?</h2><p>Capturing screenshots of the epic moments in an Xbox One video game and sharing those images with your friends is equally simple.

When coupled with the current coronavirus situation, working from home is vital. When we are using our own tech to work remotely – what is the best video conference app to use? Great question! Let’s find out.</p><h2 id="The-Best-Video-Conference-App-For-Android-And-iPhone"><a href="#The-Best-Video-Conference-App-For-Android-And-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="The Best Video Conference App For Android And iPhone"></a>The Best Video Conference App For Android And iPhone</h2><h3 id="1-Microsoft-Teams"><a href="#1-Microsoft-Teams" class="headerlink" title="1. Microsoft Teams"></a>1. Microsoft Teams</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/microsoft-teams-app.JPG"                      alt="Microsoft Teams"                ></p><p>Supported Platform: Both Android and iOS</p><p>Microsoft Teams is the best conferencing app for Cloud collaborations. It has been explicitly made with sharing in mind. It also comes with file sharing, business conferencing, and full integration with Office 365. Arguably the best virtual meeting app overall, Microsoft Teams offers both versatility and performance.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Very high compatibility, cross-device, cross-OS communications.</li><li>If you get 365, this comes at no additional charge—integration of everything Microsoft.</li><li>File backups are made when you transfer. They are also fully searchable.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>It is high on storage.</li><li>Channel limit set at 100. Go past it with a single team, and you will need to start deleting data.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Zoom-Cloud-Meetings"><a href="#2-Zoom-Cloud-Meetings" class="headerlink" title="2. Zoom Cloud Meetings"></a>2. Zoom Cloud Meetings</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-cloud-meetings-app.JPG"                      alt="Zoom Cloud Meetings"                ></p><p>Supported Platform: Android, iOS, every other computer OS.</p><p>Zoom Cloud Meetings is the best video conference app of our generation. With fantastic HD quality in both audio and video departments, Zoom has earned a place among the top apps recently downloaded, overall. You can also <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record Zoom meeting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if necessary. If you don’t use Zoom Cloud and still want to record the meeting sessions, you can use some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Zooming Meeting Record Apps for iOS and Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to record.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Syncs with your calendar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to allow <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >scheduling <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, inviting, and canceling with ease. Easy joining, too.</li><li>Cross-device compatibility lets you use it on your desktop, phone, or tablet – anywhere you like.</li><li>You can record or annotate your meetings. There is even an option to transcribe your speech, which you can later search back.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Can reach 100% of your phone performance while you use it.</li><li>If you have an old Android, then just run it on your laptop.</li></ul><h3 id="3-ezTalks-Video-Meetings"><a href="#3-ezTalks-Video-Meetings" class="headerlink" title="3. ezTalks Video Meetings"></a>3. ezTalks Video Meetings</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/eztalks-app.JPG"                      alt="ezTalks Video Meetings"                ></p><p>Supported Platform: Both Android and iOS, as well as browser, Mac, and Windows.</p><p>Third on our list is ezTalks Video Meetings. Again, high compatibility across devices earns it a right place on the list of the best conferencing apps. In terms of file sharing and screen sharing, ezTalks goes above and beyond the call of duty to bring you a seamless video conferencing service.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Gallery sharing, screen sharing, file sharing, and whiteboard facility.</li><li>No install can answer on either your phone or your browser, easy to join.</li><li>They are ergonomically designed to work with a patchy phone signal and not charge you extra for location.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>It’s not as well known as it should be.</li><li>Again, it is high on storage. We doubt any of the top video conferencing apps take anything less than 75% of your processing power.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Cisco-Webex-Meetings"><a href="#4-Cisco-Webex-Meetings" class="headerlink" title="4. Cisco Webex Meetings"></a>4. Cisco Webex Meetings</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cisco-webex-meetings-app.JPG"                      alt="Cisco Webex Meetings"                ></p><p>Supported Platform: Both Android and iOS.</p><p>For a service that focuses on ‘tele presentation’, you need Cisco Webex Meetings. They have been doing their best to provide the masses with a virtual presence for years now. Cisco meetings have all the usual audio and visual features – but they specialize in providing a secure platform from which to conduct business. This stable platform is what makes them the best video conferencing app for business, in our eyes.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>It is a very secure system, which incorporates both audio and visual meetings of high quality.</li><li>Whiteboard and screen sharing capabilities.</li><li>It works from most high-tech cars. Toyota SDL car support comes as standard.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>There are compatibility flaws between whiteboard use and iOS in some cases.</li><li>Screen widget for Webex is only available for Android users.</li></ul><h3 id="5-Skype-for-Business"><a href="#5-Skype-for-Business" class="headerlink" title="5. Skype for Business"></a>5. Skype for Business</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-app.JPG"                      alt="Skype for Business"                ></p><p>Supported Platform: Works across all devices and are very, very proud of it!</p><p>We love that the initial video meeting app has now developed a new arm, specifically for companies. Skype for Business allows you to keep in touch with remote workers with a few short clicks. One of the best features of Skype is that they have been around for a long time. They have video calling down to a fine art. Second best? It is a unified communications platform that integrates with just about everything you will ever need. You can also <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >share screen on Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with others.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Maximum compatibility – laptop, tablet, iPhone, Android – Skype for Business works with everything.</li><li>It can be used with Outlook and fully integrates everything Microsoft.</li><li>Very easy to learn user interface with options for training and various helpful features. Things like translation allows it to be the best video conferencing app for business – or at least up in the top three.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Audio and Video tends to stutter and glitch.</li><li>Uses all your phone processing power to keep it going.</li></ul><h3 id="6-GoToMeeting"><a href="#6-GoToMeeting" class="headerlink" title="6. GoToMeeting"></a>6. GoToMeeting</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gotomeeting%20-app.JPG"                      alt="GoToMeeting app"                ></p><p>Supported Platform: iPad, iPhone, and Android</p><p>Another top video conferencing app is GoToMeeting – especially if you want a professional-looking app. They promote the fact that it can be used for teleconferencing, online meetings, and also product demonstrations – which is a nice addition. You could, feasibly, use this service to make a pitch or presentation. It’s highly scalable, too, so it can be used across large or small businesses.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Aside from calls – you can have one-on-one while you are in a big meeting. Allows you to remind people on the fly.</li><li>It is a great conference video call app that comes with screen sharing and even remote screen contributions.</li><li>Easy to use, join, and negotiate.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Reviewers have reported poor error reporting with little fixes.</li><li>In some areas, it is too sensitive for those running meetings.</li></ul><h3 id="7-Google-Hangouts-Meet"><a href="#7-Google-Hangouts-Meet" class="headerlink" title="7. Google Hangouts Meet"></a>7. Google Hangouts Meet</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hangouts-app.JPG"                      alt="Google Hangouts Meet"                ></p><p>Supported Platform: iPhone, iPad, Android</p><p>The only reason that Google Hangouts Meet is number 7 on our list is that it is a better service for friend catchups than specifically for business meetings. Although it is a great video meeting app, we would opt for a specifically designed business app if we were looking for a work conference suite. On the upside, everyone has a Google account and knows how to use it. They also give unrivaled integration and quality of calls.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Fantastic clarity of audio and visual calling with loads of options for addons.</li><li>Sign in with your Google account, great integration across their range of products.</li><li>Meet with webinar-style gatherings, perfect video meeting app for students or education.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Some features are specific to G Suite customers.</li><li>Although aimed at business users, they get low reviews because it should be a social tool.</li></ul><h3 id="8-Slack"><a href="#8-Slack" class="headerlink" title="8. Slack"></a>8. Slack</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-app.JPG"                      alt="Slack"                ></p><p>Supported Platform: iOS or Android, Mac, Windows, Linux</p><p>Slack is a brilliant conference call meeting app in its own right – but we don’t love it for being the best virtual meeting app. We love it for being the figurative water cooler of the digital workplace. It’s not that we would use it as a conference call video app, it’s more that we prefer to use it to catch up on office gossip, do daily check-ins, or give progress reports. What we’re saying is that it is an excellent in-house communications tool. We think there are better inter-office tools for making the best virtual meeting apps.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>A friendly place to chat during business hours that allows you to check on remote workers.</li><li>There is a certain amount of personalization between workers accounts.</li><li>Think of it as a virtual workplace like an office space in the virtual world. It’s less about the video calling and more about being able to check in with your colleagues.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Intended for those that need a central location to work from, which is both good and bad.</li><li>We wouldn’t use Slack for a friend group – but again, this is good and bad.</li></ul><h2 id="The-Key-Takeaways"><a href="#The-Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="The Key Takeaways"></a>The Key Takeaways</h2><p>Most of the best video conferencing apps are designed for both business and social use. However, most of them are better at one or the other. The best conferencing app for you will depend entirely on your needs as an individual, but it is probably on our list!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/mi-11-the-ultimate-mobile-camera-to-record-your-lifes-moments/"><u>Mi 11  The Ultimate Mobile Camera to Record Your Life's Moments</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-top-10-gratis-video-call-tools-for-virtual-gatherings/"><u>[New] Top 10 Gratis Video Call Tools for Virtual Gatherings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-unleashing-the-power-of-fbx-for-in-game-capture/"><u>[Updated] Unleashing the Power of FBX for In-Game Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-leading-budget-tech-for-real-time-pc-screen-mirroring-for-2024/"><u>[New] Leading Budget Tech for Real-Time PC Screen Mirroring for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-streamline-your-screencast-the-best-obs-tools-insider-tips/"><u>[Updated] Streamline Your Screencast  The Best OBS Tools Insider Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-minecraft-homestead-blueprint-6-10/"><u>In 2024, Minecraft Homestead Blueprint #6-10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-gaming-through-time-with-top-5-pc-based-ps1-game-emulators/"><u>In 2024, Gaming Through Time with Top 5 PC-Based PS1 Game Emulators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-accelerated-video-maker-time-lapse-edition/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Accelerated Video Maker  Time-Lapse Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-boost-collaboration-in-slack-select-your-ideal-10-free-apps/"><u>[New] Boost Collaboration in Slack  Select Your Ideal 10 Free Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/new-how-to-clone-yourself-on-tiktok-for-2024/"><u>[New] How to Clone Yourself on TikTok for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-safely-download-facebook-media-on-windowsmac/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Safely Download Facebook Media on Windows/Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-immersive-recording-enhancing-your-gaming-with-windows-11-for-2024/"><u>[New] Immersive Recording  Enhancing Your Gaming with Windows 11 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/prime-selection-of-streaming-services-explored-for-2024/"><u>Prime Selection of Streaming Services Explored for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/updated-best-5-video-editing-platforms-that-dont-feature-in-youtoo/"><u>[Updated] Best 5 Video Editing Platforms That Don't Feature in YouToo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/in-2024-timecode-made-easy-top-online-and-mobile-calculators/"><u>In 2024, Timecode Made Easy Top Online and Mobile Calculators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-the-seamless-tutorial-for-image-background-cleanup-on-canva/"><u>[Updated] The Seamless Tutorial for Image Background Cleanup on Canva</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-can-vivo-v27emirror-share-to-pc-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How Can Vivo V27eMirror Share to PC? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-insta-snap-authenticity-guide-unveiling-selfies-truths/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Insta Snap Authenticity Guide  Unveiling Selfies' Truths</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-live-your-dreams-insights-into-the-panasonic-hx-a1-cam/"><u>2024 Approved  Live Your Dreams  Insights Into the Panasonic HX-A1 Cam</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

And the thing I love most about Ali’s overgrown fairy buildings is that Smile Hutch is changed from a Palace to a small cottage with a garden full of flowers.</p><h3 id="2-Bathhouse-Hot-Spring-3"><a href="#2-Bathhouse-Hot-Spring-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Bathhouse Hot Spring"></a>2.Bathhouse Hot Spring</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bathhouse-hot-spring.png"                      alt="bathhouse-hot-spring"                ></p><p>At the north of Pelican Town, you can find Bathhouse Hot Spring. In the bathhouse hot spring, you can energize yourself and feel refreshed, but the whir of fans is a different kind of feel which you can find in an idyllic valley if you want the sound of smooth water running through hot spring while gameplay, you should use the mod bathhouse hot spring. The last update that we got on the bathhouse hot spring mod was from 2017, so we can say its upper back that another update can be a better version.</p><h3 id="3-Modern-Gothic-Interior-3"><a href="#3-Modern-Gothic-Interior-3" class="headerlink" title="3.Modern Gothic Interior"></a>3.Modern Gothic Interior</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/modern-gothic-interior.png"                      alt="modern-gothic-interior"                ></p><p>In terms of interior design, modder Coldazrael’s Modern Gothic Interior restyles many pieces with dark wood and stark white textiles.

Featuring square jaws and more robust characteristics, all of the figures have a darker look. They do not match in with the vanilla Pelican Town, but they’re a welcome change of pace from the charm. The Portrait mod, which allows for higher quality avatar portraits, is being used in the portraits.</p><h3 id="5-Stardew-Anime-Mods-3"><a href="#5-Stardew-Anime-Mods-3" class="headerlink" title="5.Stardew Anime Mods"></a>5.Stardew Anime Mods</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-anime-mods.png"                      alt="stardew-anime-mods"                ></p><p>For legitimate reasons, Stardew Anime Mods is one of the most beloved portrait mods of Stardew. It has pixel graphics in detail and is vividly hued, and it blends in well with vanilla Stardew Valley. However, it primarily contains portraits of Stardew Valley’s young lady, which means bachelors will appear less dazzling in contrast.</p><h3 id="6-Monster-Valley-3"><a href="#6-Monster-Valley-3" class="headerlink" title="6.Monster Valley"></a>6.Monster Valley</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/monster-valley-poster.jpg"                      alt="monster-valley-poster"                ></p><p>For the last year, video games about monsters meetings, swords, and birds have made their way into the gaming mainstream, and Monster Valley follows in their crazy tracks. The images and sprites of Pelican Town’s most eligible families are turned into terrifying replacements in Monster Valley. Sebastian and Robin are transformed into devils, while Maru and Demetrius are transformed into stitched dolls. Elliott is transformed into a merman.</p><h3 id="7-Elle’s-Cat-Replacements-3"><a href="#7-Elle’s-Cat-Replacements-3" class="headerlink" title="7.Elle’s Cat Replacements"></a>7.Elle’s Cat Replacements</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/elles-cat-replacements.png"                      alt="elles-cat-replacements"                ></p><p>Elle’s Cat Replacements can convert your farm cat into anything, e.g., calico to a tortoiseshell.

Screen recordings are not immune to background noises and for that reason, anyone using screen capturing software should do everything in their power to ensure that the environment in which they are recording a video is as quiet as it possibly can be.</p><p>Creating perfect conditions for audio recording is often hard, due to unforeseen events that can happen while the screen recording session is in progress. Most modern screen recording and video editing computer programs provide features that enable their users to reduce noise levels in their videos significantly. In this article, we are going to provide our readers with a few different methods of reducing or removing noise from their videos.</p><ul><li><a href="#reducenoisefree">Part 1: How to Reduce Audio Noise in a Video Recording For Free</a></li><li><a href="#reducenoisefilmorascrn">A better way to Reduce Audio Noise in a Video Recording with One-click</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Reduce-Audio-Noise-in-a-Video-Recording-For-Free-with-Audacity"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Reduce-Audio-Noise-in-a-Video-Recording-For-Free-with-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Reduce Audio Noise in a Video Recording For Free with Audacity"></a>Part 1: How to Reduce Audio Noise in a Video Recording For Free with Audacity</h2><p>It can hardly be stressed enough how important it is to be prepared for the post-production process, because during the time you spend in the editing room you’ll realize that if you are missing something which may seem trivial, like a room tone recording can prove to be crucial for the success of your video making endeavor.</p><p>A <strong>room tone</strong> is an audio recording of the atmospheric sounds of the room in which you recorded the video. It is frequently used as a baseline for the soundtrack of an entire video since it can help the software remove the unwanted noises from the video’s original audio file. Room tone recordings become even more important if you already know that you’ll have to deal with background noises during the video editing process.</p><p>Besides the room tone recording, you will also need some audio editing software, such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" >Audacity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to remove or at least reduce the levels of audio noise. However, you can only use this software to work with audio files.</p><p>In order to start removing background noises from an audio file, you first need to import the file into Audacity and place it on the software’s timeline. Afterward, you should place the room tone recording to the timeline as well, and then select the silent part of the recording. Once you’ve selected the portion of the room tone recording you’d like to use, find the <strong>Effects</strong> menu, and select the <strong>Noise Reduction</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/noise-reduction-with-audacity.jpg"                      alt="Noise Reductioin"                ></p><p>In the next step, you should click on the <strong>Get Noise Profile</strong> feature, and proceed to deselect the room tone audio file on the timeline. Go back to the Noise Reduction option, and click play to preview the changes you’ve made. If you are not happy with the results, you can adjust the sliders until you are perfectly happy with the sound file you created.</p><h2 id="Part-2-A-Better-Way-to-Remove-Background-Audio-Noise-With-One-Click-After-Recording"><a href="#Part-2-A-Better-Way-to-Remove-Background-Audio-Noise-With-One-Click-After-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A Better Way to Remove Background Audio Noise With One-Click After Recording"></a>Part 2: A Better Way to Remove Background Audio Noise With One-Click After Recording</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-editing-panel.jpg"                      alt="Filmora audio editing"                ></p><p>Audacity doesn’t offer any video editing features and you can only use to edit audio files. Removing background audio noises after recording with a software program like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a better option since it enables you to edit audio and video files in the same project.</p><p>Import the video file into Filmora video editor and place the file on the timeline. Select the audio file and head over to the Audio menu on the left side of the screen. Make sure that the Enable checkbox, in the Denoise menu is marked and then proceed to select Weak, Mid or Strong value. You can play the video and hear if the background noises have been removed. If the audio track has too much noise, you can use the Mute option or you can detach the audio file from the video file and delete it. That’s how easy it is to remove background noises with Wondershare Filmora.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora X Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora X Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Regardless of the type of video you are creating, having crystal clear audio is equally important as producing sharp, high-resolution videos. Video clips that have a great soundtrack are more likely to be a success on social media, which is why you should do everything in your power to create videos that don’t contain any of the unpleasant noises you might have accidentally captured during a screen recording session.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mp4-capture-and-analysis-toolkit/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  MP4 Capture & Analysis Toolkit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-top-7-shooter-games-you-must-play-today/"><u>[New] Top 7 Shooter Games You Must Play Today</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-6-efficient-urban-minecraft-residences/"><u>[New] In 2024, Top 6 Efficient Urban Minecraft Residences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-experts-guide-to-recording-mp4-videos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Expert's Guide to Recording MP4 Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-ticklish-titles-laugh-out-loud-gaming-for-children/"><u>[Updated] Ticklish Titles  Laugh-Out-Loud Gaming for Children</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-capture-video-like-a-pro-on-modern-laptops/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Capture Video Like a Pro on Modern Laptops</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-obs-studio-vs-fraps-which-is-a-better-screen-capture-software/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, OBS Studio vs Fraps – Which Is A Better Screen Capture Software?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-digital-diaries-reviewing-the-best-personal-devices/"><u>In 2024, Digital Diaries  Reviewing the Best Personal Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/ideal-camcorders-for-high-definition-podcasts/"><u>Ideal Camcorders for High-Definition Podcasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-visual-harmony-in-audio-a-step-by-step-guide-for-creative-composers-photo-sonics-updated-edition/"><u>Updated In 2024, Visual Harmony in Audio A Step-by-Step Guide for Creative Composers Photo Sonics, Updated Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-navigate-the-world-of-games-top-12-pc-clickers-revealed-for-2024/"><u>[New] Navigate the World of Games  Top 12 PC Clickers Revealed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/flawless-approach-securing-gotomeeting-recordings/"><u>Flawless Approach  Securing GoToMeeting Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-explore-the-finest-6-mobile-applications-for-instantaneous-voice-change/"><u>Updated In 2024, Explore the Finest 6 Mobile Applications for Instantaneous Voice Change</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-rights-infringement-abrupt-content-elimination/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Rights Infringement  Abrupt Content Elimination</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/demystifying-screen-record-snapchat-a-beginners-handbook/"><u>Demystifying Screen Record Snapchat  A Beginner's Handbook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-dvd-burning-made-easy-convert-videos-to-dvd-on-windows-and-mac/"><u>Updated In 2024, DVD Burning Made Easy Convert Videos to DVD on Windows and Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/6-free-software-to-convert-youtube-to-mp3-for-iphone/"><u>6 Free Software to Convert YouTube to MP3 for iPhone</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Best-Practices-for-OBS-Based-Skype-Recording"><a href="#Best-Practices-for-OBS-Based-Skype-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Best Practices for OBS-Based Skype Recording"></a>Best Practices for OBS-Based Skype Recording</h2><p>Video interviews for remote jobs are quite common these days because of this quickening pace of the world around us. And these interviews are recorded to further evaluate the information exchanged, so for the recording of these videos certain tools have also been introduced in the market. I myself have used a few of them; and the most popular these days are easily zoom and skype. Both these programs offer clear communication among all concerned parties. The reason why I want to discuss skype here is that zoom’s video quality is an issue, it has got very low video quality and the audio, it records in one track so if you have made a mistake in the speaking or something audible, it will remain there.</p><p>So in this article I will discuss that how can you record your skype videos using OBS. Skype has been extensively used for quite a long time now and it hasn’t lost its edge over the years but has actually upgraded and improved its services with time. Coming to OBS which is an open-source software used widely for streaming purposes. It provides an incredible experience courtesy of its variety of editing and recording options. The audio can be recorded from the system and the microphone. And video can be fetched from the webcam. Along with the recording of specific section of the screen.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Recording-Skype-Calls-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-Recording-Skype-Calls-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Recording Skype Calls with OBS"></a>Part 1: Recording Skype Calls with OBS</h2><p>To begin with shedding some light on the OBS program:</p><p>A little piece of software that can be used for both business and non-commercial purposes. Streaming on YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook is supported. It has the ability to record the screen with cursor effects. It allows you to record your screen indefinitely. Watermarks aren’t added: the video doesn’t have any watermarks. There are options for multichannel, Multilanguage, and single channel.</p><p>Now to setup the environment for screen recording we have to follow the following steps.</p><p>Initially, you’ll be required to have skype installed on your desktop along with the up-to-date version of OBS software. After installing skype you first have to make a secondary&#x2F;backup account on skype. After that you require a secondary camera as well to record yourself because your webcam can be in demand elsewhere, so you would not be able to record yourself or even the guests wouldn’t be able to see you. And then turn on the given command in skype i-e: skype&gt;settings&gt;calling&gt;advanced&gt;’allow NDI usage’ as shown in the picture. This command allows OBS to access skype videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-calling-settings-advanced-calling.jpg"                      alt="skype calling settings advanced calling"                ></p><p>After this you have to open the OBS program and set it up for skype calls, firs thing is to create a new scene, then you’re going to hit the plus button and select the capture device. Now you can see yourself on camera and screen can easily be cropped, while holding ‘Alt’, on OBS so fix it according to your liking. Then press ‘lock’ using the NDI plug-in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-program-set-up-for-skype.jpg"                      alt="obs program set up for skype"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-vlc-videos-source.jpg"                      alt="obs vlc videos source"                ></p><p>To setup NDI plugin you have to visit <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/Palakis/obs-ndi/releases/tag/4.9.1" >https://github.com/Palakis/obs-ndi/releases/tag/4.9.1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and check for the compatible version with your operating system. On this website the plugin is available for windows, mac and Linux.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obc-ndi-plugin-visit.jpg"                      alt="obc ndi plugin visit"                ></p><p>And after addition of plug in you would want to click on ‘+’ again and select NDI plugin and you can select the source video which is going to be the received video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-additon-of-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="obs additon of plug in"                ></p><p>And clicking on it will open a new window where you have to select the guest feed, which will be possible once the call has begun. The call connected will appear on the NDI plugin window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-new-window-select-the-guest-feed.jpg"                      alt="obs new window select the guest feed"                ></p><p>As you receive the call from the reciever you will see the incoming feed of him as shown in the figure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-receive-the-call.jpg"                      alt="obs receive the call"                ></p><p>So you can just resize it similarly as you did yours earlier and pressing the lock icon will stop you from mistakenly modify or change the video screen settings. Now to record the video you have to click on record button and your desktop starts recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-resize-it-similarly.jpg"                      alt="obs resize it similarly"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-OBS-Alternative-to-Record-Skype"><a href="#Part-2-OBS-Alternative-to-Record-Skype" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: OBS Alternative to Record Skype"></a>Part 2: OBS Alternative to Record Skype</h2><h3 id="Filmora"><a href="#Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Filmora"></a>Filmora</h3><p>Filmora is a very popular and perfect <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and editor designed by Wondershare.

There are options for changing the audio devices for your own computer. And I recommend that you separate your audio right now. Everything is set up in a way that everything’s going to come through one audio feed. I don’t like that. I think it’s better if you separate your audio that. Let’s say you cough during an interview or something. You’re actually able to cut that out and you can actually record a separate feed itself.</p><p><strong>Capturing Audio in OBS Studio on a Mac</strong></p><p>On a Mac, you’ll need to install an additional OBS plugin to capture audio.</p><ul><li>Install iShowU Audio Capture on your computer.</li><li>Make sure you navigate to Security &amp; Privacy in your System Preferences.</li><li>To proceed, you may need to grant permission to “Shiny White Box.”</li><li>Restart your Mac after the installation is complete.</li><li>Open Audio MIDI Setup after rebooting.</li><li>At the bottom left of the window, click the Plus button.</li><li>Select Create Multi-Output Device from the drop-down menu.</li></ul><p>So form the above discussion it can be concluded that OBS for screen recording can be a very handy tool because it has the ability to easily record skype videos along with separate audio recording to avoid interference of sounds and mix ups. The separate audio recording system allows us to manipulate and modify the sounds along with the video quality. Skype is a tool much used by the world for quite some time and it still continues to serve us with numerous improvements and updates to simplify the complex world of networking today and the tools to use it properly help us communicate better with others. Also you can add cool graphics with your video to ornate your work. So If you want to buy graphics, templates, and other similar items, even if you only have rudimentary Photoshop skills, there are a lot of really skilled designers on here with pretty affordable costs if you want to buy graphics and other similar items.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/recording-01.png"                      alt="filmra record pc screen"                ></p><ul><li>This window gives you options regarding screen size, resolution and devices which will record your audio and videos.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/recording-04.png"                      alt="filmora regard screen size"                ></p><ul><li>This window is to configure all the audio and video devices.
