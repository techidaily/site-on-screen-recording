You may use them to produce comprehensive recordings as well as recordings that are limited to a single component or window. The disadvantage is that the free versions of this software sometimes include some very inconvenient restrictions, such as a relatively short time usage or bearing of those annoying presence of watermarks, which might negatively affect the result somewhat.</p><p>We introduce you to an amazing recording software RecordCast by PearlMountain company to record your screen and webcams online. It is a web-based application designed to capture your screen, webcam, and microphone input data. The interface to use the application is very user-friendly. Moreover, it provides free usage capability of up to 5 minutes of maximum recording time. However, for longer recordings, you might need to upgrade them. Let’s have a detailed review of the RecordCast in the coming sections.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Key-Features-of-RecordCast"><a href="#Part-1-Key-Features-of-RecordCast" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Key Features of RecordCast"></a>Part 1: Key Features of RecordCast</h2><p>Software is best analyzed by the features it has to offer. The RecordCast is equipped with amazing features that you can avail of directly online through the web. Let’s discuss these features one by one to explore them for your ease.</p><p>**<strong>Free and User-Friendly</strong></p><p>The first and the foremost prevalent perk of a RecordCast is its free usage for its users. The application provides you to sign in free of cost to avail of its recording capabilities without any watermark issues. Moreover, the GUI of the web-based application is very easy to use that only needs a few steps to do the job.</p><p>**<strong>Multiple Recording Modes:</strong></p><p>With the 3 recording modes of the RecordCast, it leads all other similar software which usually has single recording modes. The three recording modes let you choose to record webcam + screen simultaneously or one at a time.</p><p>**<strong>All-in-One:</strong></p><p>The RecordCast is not only designed to record screens but with its video editing tools, you can now edit, trim, change colors, apply filters and put artistic effects on any video online. This amazing feature makes it a competitor for video editor tools too.</p><p>**<strong>Protected:</strong></p><p>With great care for privacy and security, RecordCast stores and edit your video or recordings locally. It doesn’t upload your content to the web servers instead, it never shares your content with any third party.</p><p>**<strong>Fair Pricing:</strong></p><p>The free version of RecordCast let you record a screen or webcam for a maximum of 5 minutes. However, it can be upgraded to its premium version so you can avail all its features by only paying 2.99 $ per month. This is very fair considering other similar software pricing.</p><p>**<strong>Compatibility:</strong></p><p>Due to the online nature of the RecordCast, it is compatible with any computer. Whether it is a Mac or Windows, you will not have to set up any compatibility settings before using it. This gives it an edge over other similar software.</p><p>**<strong>No Storage:</strong></p><p>Normally, you need to download an application and then install it for its usage. However, in the case of RecordCast, you save a considerable amount of storage by not installing it on your PC.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948876/19272" target="_top" id="1948876">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948876" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948876/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-RecordCast"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-RecordCast" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use RecordCast"></a>Part 2: How to Use RecordCast</h2><p>With the three RecordCast, you can record your screen or webcam, download it and edit it the way you like to online.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Ultimate-Technique-Programming-a-Time-Counter-in-OBS"><a href="#Ultimate-Technique-Programming-a-Time-Counter-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Ultimate Technique: Programming a Time Counter in OBS"></a>Ultimate Technique: Programming a Time Counter in OBS</h2><p>OBS Studio is arguably the best free, open-source screen recorder for Mac, Windows, and Linux computers. It packs powerful features that make screen recording fun, engaging, and convenient. But in this guidepost, we’ll dwell on the little-known <strong>OBS countdown timer</strong>.</p><p>So, what is the OBS Studio countdown timer, and why do you need to make one? This article discusses that and how to add a countdown timer overlay to your local videos using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Let’s dig in!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-OBS-Countdown-Timers"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-OBS-Countdown-Timers" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is OBS Countdown Timers?"></a>Part 1: What Is OBS Countdown Timers?</h2><p>You probably don’t need a further introduction to a countdown timer if you’re often watching action movies or marking calendars. But clear doubts, a countdown timer is basically the remaining time in years, weeks, days, hours, minutes, or seconds before a start of an event. A good example is those James Bond movies where a bomb has, let’s say, 60 seconds before exploding.</p><p>With that said, you can use the <strong>OBS timer countdown</strong> in multiple ways. For example, you can use it to pump up excitement before a much anticipated live streaming session starts. Remember that OBS Studio supports live streaming to popular platforms like YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-1.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer"                ></p><p>So, the timer will tell viewers the duration they’ll have to wait before the next live session. You can even add an action text after the timer ends. A countdown timer can also help you ensure that the viewer sticks around until the end of an event or video.</p><p>Picture this; you can be a fitness trainer on YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram, etc. In that case, you’ll need to perform each set of exercises for a specific duration, then rest for like 30 or 60 seconds.</p><p>So, add a timer to the video to guide the trainees throughout the session. This helps make the session more engaging and fun. Whichever the reasons you have to add an <strong>OBS count down timer</strong>, the objective is simple; communicate to the viewers the time left before an event starts or ends.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Add-a-Countdown-Timer-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Add-a-Countdown-Timer-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Add a Countdown Timer in OBS"></a>Part 2: How To Add a Countdown Timer in OBS</h2><p>Up to this point, you might think that adding an OBS countdown clock is such a complicated task. After all, OBS isn’t the most beginner-friendly screen recorder to use. But don’t fret because adding a countdown timer is one of the most straightforward things to do in OBS Studio. Let’s do that!</p><p>Step1 Fire up OBS Studio and select a recording scene on which you want to apply the countdown timer. Once the scene is ready, tap the Plus button on the Sources section, then select the Text Source. Now give the source a name. For instance, you can name it Timer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-2.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer add a text source"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137412/7443" target="_top" id="2137412">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137412" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137412/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step2 Now you’ll see a pop-up window to customize how the timer will look. For example, click the Select font button to customize the font settings for the countdown timer. You can also customize things like opacity, gradient, background color, alignment, and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-3.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer customize timer details"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082533/7443" target="_top" id="2082533">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082533" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082533/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step3 Next, click the Tools tab and then tap Scripts. Then, select the countdown.lua file and customize the countdown descriptions on the pop-up window. You can change the countdown duration and the final text after the countdown. Don’t also forget to select Timer as the Text Source. The OBS countdown timer will immediately start counting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-4.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer add the timer file"                ></p><h2 id="Pro-Tip-How-To-Utilize-an-Overlay-To-Level-Up-Your-Countdown-Timer"><a href="#Pro-Tip-How-To-Utilize-an-Overlay-To-Level-Up-Your-Countdown-Timer" class="headerlink" title="Pro Tip: How To Utilize an Overlay To Level Up Your Countdown Timer"></a>Pro Tip: How To Utilize an Overlay To Level Up Your Countdown Timer</h2><p>You’ll definitely need precise timing to get the most out of the <strong>timer countdown on OBS</strong>. Also, sometimes you can record a video on your smartphone or camera and customize it with a countdown timer. If that’s the case, consider using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>It’s a professional-grade video editor for macOS and Windows systems that allows you to add countdown timer overlays to any video. Unlike OBS, this method will enable you to add timer overlays to specific scenes on the footage, including the intro part. Even best is that the countdown timers come in multiple styles, and you can customize the timer with appropriate background audio.</p><p><strong>Steps to create a countdown timer with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><h5 id="Step1-Start-a-new-video-project"><a href="#Step1-Start-a-new-video-project" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Start a new video project"></a>Step1 Start a new video project</h5><p>Install and run Filmora on your PC, and start a New Project. But before that, select the video aspect ratio. This is important if you’re creating videos for social media sharing. For example, choose 16:1 for YouTube and 4:3 for WhatsApp Status videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-5.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer add new project"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Upload-the-video-to-edit"><a href="#Step2-Upload-the-video-to-edit" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Upload the video to edit"></a>Step2 Upload the video to edit</h5><p>Tap Import Media to upload a video from local or external drives.

Learn all the essential elements and steps to record voice over like professionals.</p><p>For every video you come across, the audio part is equally important as the visual part. Even when the visual part is top-notch, if the audio part such as background music and the voice narration is not good enough, you lose interest in the video. Therefore, you have to pay equal attention to the video recording as well as voiceover recording. A voiceover is basically a person speaking in the background as the video is playing along to make proper sense as well as to add more context to the video.</p><p>A voiceover recording can be describing the video, explaining concepts, highlighting important points, and likewise. Generally, a voiceover is added to the video after the video is already recorded. In order to record a good voice over, there are certain essential elements you need to have beforehand. In this article, we will explain why and how to record a voice over and how to make a voice over good to get everyone’s attention and appreciation.</p><h2 id="1-Why-To-Record-A-Voiceover"><a href="#1-Why-To-Record-A-Voiceover" class="headerlink" title="1. Why To Record A Voiceover?"></a>1. Why To Record A Voiceover?</h2><p>The engagement on a video depends both on how good the video content as well as how good the audio is. The audio in a video is not just about background music. A good voiceover can do wonders in terms of retaining the attention of the viewers as well as showcasing your personality traits.</p><p>A voice over recording is a must when you are making instructional, educational, and informational videos. Imagine watching a tutorial video where there is no voice to explain what is happening on the screen, everyone will leave the video immediately. Therefore, a voiceover essentially explains the video so that everyone can understand and even relate properly.</p><h2 id="2-Essential-elements-for-a-good-voice-over"><a href="#2-Essential-elements-for-a-good-voice-over" class="headerlink" title="2. Essential elements for a good voice over"></a>2. Essential elements for a good voice over</h2><p>You have to ensure that your voice over recording is great from all perspectives. There are certain essential elements that you have to get right in order to make a voice over mediocre to good and even great.</p><p><strong>Audio Clarity</strong></p><p>Every great voiceover has perfect voice quality and comfortable volume. Audiences may find it distracting if the voiceover recording has a muddy and muffled sound. They will definitely miss the important message that you may want to share through the video. Low volume will make people difficult to hear whereas too loud can cause irritation.</p><p>To ensure audio clarity, professionals use voice over recording studio. If you generally record voice over at home, make sure you do it when there is absolute silence in the background. Besides, the mic quality should be top-notch to pick your voice only as close to original and eliminate background noise.</p><p><strong>Pacing of Pitch</strong></p><p>Pacing is the speed of how fast or slow your pitch is. If you go too fast, your audience will not be able to catch you. On the contrary, the slow pace can be boring. It is important to have a natural pace for everyone to understand as well as stay interested. Therefore, maintain a good pace throughout the video but take pauses to add audio effects. Pauses are a part of pacing for allowing the listeners to grab information and for you to breathe properly so that mic does not catch it.</p><p><strong>Vocal Tone</strong></p><p>Vocal tone is about speaking in a pleasant, soothing but natural manner. You need to make sure that the tone has to be engaging but friendly. Sometimes, you may have to fake it but it must not sound fake or boring for the listeners. A proper vocal tone comes with regular practice and experimentation.</p><p><strong>Pronunciation</strong></p><p>Always make sure that you pronounce every word correctly. The listeners must clearly understand what you speak clearly. Avoid mumbling, over-enunciating, and shouting. At times, you may have to avoid your regional accent to make the audience understand with more clarity. Always ask feedback from listeners to be better at pronouncing certain words.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1030129/11832" target="_top" id="1030129">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1030129" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1030129/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-How-To-Record-A-Voice-Over"><a href="#3-How-To-Record-A-Voice-Over" class="headerlink" title="3. How To Record A Voice Over?"></a>3. How To Record A Voice Over?</h2><p>Here are the steps to follow to record voiceover properly like professionals.</p><p><strong>Getting Ready</strong></p><ul><li>Location: Look for a quiet place to work. Professional voice artists opt for a soundproof room to cancel out external noise. However, you can even go for a quiet area where there is no distracting noise. Microphones can pick up ambient noise that will be reflected in the voiceover recording. Apart from human conversations, you will also have to be careful of the sound coming from electronic gadgets such as computer fans.</li><li>Microphone: Look for a top-notch microphone as per your budget. Consider using a pop filter if you are going to use an external mic. It helps to reduce the distracting sounds with certain alphabets as well as the sound of breathing. Among affordable microphones, you may use modern earbuds or headphones with mic that you use for your smartphone. There are many USB microphones available in the market at an affordable value.</li><li>Voiceover Recorder Software: You need a good-quality audio recording software to record voiceover as well as edit the recording as per requirement. There are many free as well as premium audio recording software available in the market today. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as you can record voice over for any video like professionals as well as edit the recording of audio and video in the same software.</li></ul><p><strong>Writing A Proper Script</strong></p><p>The best way to sound professional during a voice over is to use a proper script. When you don’t use a script, then there can be a lot of pauses and you may try to think about what you will have to say next. When you use a script, you have everything planned out beforehand. Besides, you can also practice what to say when you have a script with pointers and even full explanation of each point. Try to read the script many times and be careful of the words and phrases that can be awkward. Adjust the script accordingly so that it will fit perfectly in the recording.</p><p><strong>Performing A Test Recording</strong></p><p>It is always advisable to go for a test recording to ensure that everything is working properly. In a test recording, you don’t have to go for the entire script but just a few paragraphs. Check if the audio is clear, the volume is at the right level, and the recording is seamless. Check the audio quality by using headphones and not computer speakers.</p><p>**<strong>Microphone Placement</strong> - If you keep the microphone too close to the mouth, there will be all kinds of weird sounds including air puffs. Too far placement will make your voice get fainted. The perfect placement should be about 6 to 8 inches from the mouth and it has to be slightly below the chin. Check the test recording carefully as some microphones can pick up sounds from the table and the computer.</p><p><strong>Recording Voice Over</strong></p><p>So by now, you have the video for which you want to record voiceover. You have connected the microphone to your computer. Now, it is time to record your voice over with voice over recorder Wondershare Filmora.

The new iPhone 7 comes with an array of new next-gen technology that is sure to leave you breathless. There is no headphone jack, the phone feature new and improved display, the iPhone 7 plus has rear dual cameras that Apple says is a game changer. The phone is waterproof, and it also comes with a new chic design with a variety of colors to choose from such as ‘Jet Black’.</p><p> Bloggers and Vloggers have a reason to smile with the release of the new iPhone 7. Making tutorials is now easier with the new iPhone. There are several ways to go about. You can either use Quicktime on Mac, Reflector on PC or a third party app called AirShou. All of these methods are great, but you want to find the technique that best fits your purposes.</p><h2 id="How-to-record-the-screen-of-iPhone-7-7-Plus"><a href="#How-to-record-the-screen-of-iPhone-7-7-Plus" class="headerlink" title="How to record the screen of iPhone 7&#x2F;7 Plus"></a>How to record the screen of iPhone 7&#x2F;7 Plus</h2><p><strong>Update:</strong> Now with iOS 11, you can just record the screen with its built-in tool, check this video to know how-to steps:</p><h4 id="Method-1-Using-Quicktime-on-Mac"><a href="#Method-1-Using-Quicktime-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Method 1 Using Quicktime on Mac"></a>Method 1 Using Quicktime on Mac</h4><p> On the new iPhone 7, recording your screen with Quicktime will require you to have two things.</p><ul><li>a) Mac with OS X (Yosemite) or later</li><li>b) Lightning Port and iOS 8 or later</li></ul><p> <strong>How to Record iPhone 7 Screen Using Quicktime on Mac</strong></p><ul><li>1. First, you need to connect the iPhone 7 to your Mac using the lightning cable.</li><li>2. Once the connection is detected, start the Quicktime software on your Mac.</li><li>3. Look for the File option and select ‘Record a Movie.’</li><li>4. Look for the record button and select the dropdown arrow to show more options.</li><li>5. There, you will find the option to record the screen of your iPhone 7. Immediately you select this option, you will notice that your iPhone’s screen is duplicated on your Mac.</li><li>6. If you only want to record the screen without any voice over sound, then click the ‘None’ option as your microphone. If you want to track your on-screen clicks, then select the ‘Show Mouse Clicks’ option.</li><li>7. Use the volume slider to monitor the recording’s audio.</li><li>8. If you want to record a certain portion of your screen, simply drag the area you want to record and then tap the recording button within that area to start recording, otherwise, if it’s the whole screen, simply tap anywhere on the screen to start recording.</li></ul><p> Check this video to see detailed steps</p><h4 id="Method-2-Using-Reflector-on-PC"><a href="#Method-2-Using-Reflector-on-PC" class="headerlink" title="Method 2 Using Reflector on PC"></a>Method 2 Using Reflector on PC</h4><p> Using Reflector is probably the easiest and most convenient way to record your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 plus screen. Since it’s a third-party app, you will need to first download it to your computer, then simply install it on you Mac, Windows PC or Chrome Book. For Reflector to work on your iPhone, you need to have installed Airplay on your device. Reflector works the same way Quicktime does, by mirroring your iPhone 7 screen on the computer’s screen.</p><p> Launch Reflector on your computer then launch Airplay on your device and then ensure that ‘Mirroring’ option is turned on. Once your iPhone detects your computer, connect to it and then simply record your IPhone screen with your computer.</p><p> Check this video to see detailed steps</p><p> The beauty about this method is that one, it caters for everyone, unlike using Quicktime which is only for Mac users and two, it does not need any cables or adapters since it is wireless.</p><h4 id="Method-3-Using-the-AirShou-App"><a href="#Method-3-Using-the-AirShou-App" class="headerlink" title="Method 3 Using the AirShou App"></a>Method 3 Using the AirShou App</h4><ul><li>a) Download AirShou directly on your iPhone 7. Users with iOS 9.3 or higher are required to set back their dates to 2012 for the apps to install without issues.</li><li>b) You will get a popup telling you that the app isn’t trusted, but go ahead to your settings and allow this program to be installed.</li><li>c) Before you start recording, make sure ‘mirroring’ in airplay is on and your device is selected.</li><li>d) Simply launch the AirShou app and then create a free account and then start recording.</li></ul><p> Check this video to see detailed steps</p><p> This app requires no jailbreaking and will work on iOS 7 and 8 as well as iOS 9 or higher.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993645">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993645.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993645">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993645.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993645%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993645/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-edit-your-recorded-videos"><a href="#How-to-edit-your-recorded-videos" class="headerlink" title="How to edit your recorded videos"></a>How to edit your recorded videos</h2><p> Video Editing with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> WondershareFilmora has been proven effective in editing recorded videos in iPhone 7 and previous versions.</p><ul><li>a) It supports a bunch of video formats such as .mp4, .avi, .mov, .avchd and lots more.</li><li>b) It enables you to trim, crop, combine, and split and cut your video(s).</li><li>c) It has an amazing filter gallery and awesome effects.</li><li>d) You can save the edited video in any format you choose, and enough to fit in your phone.</li><li>e) Edited videos are burnable on DVD, and can be uploaded on the internet.</li></ul><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135394/19272" target="_top" id="2135394">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135394" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135394/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Now you have an idea of how to record your iPhone 7 screen with all these amazing methods.

In addition, most of these platforms grant you access to various collaboration tools that make the participants in a meeting more productive.</p><p><strong>Screen sharing</strong> is undoubtedly one of the most useful collaboration tools video conferencing services can offer, as it allows the users to share a live feed of their computer screens with all other attendees of a web conference. This, in turn, enables the swift flow of information between all participants in a video conference and it gives them immediate insight into everything that is happening on a shared screen.</p><p>We’ve done some researches and find out some video conferencing services that offers screen sharing. In this article we are going to take you through the ten best options you can use free of charge.</p><h2 id="The-Ten-Best-Video-Conferencing-Software-That-Provide-Screen-Sharing-Options"><a href="#The-Ten-Best-Video-Conferencing-Software-That-Provide-Screen-Sharing-Options" class="headerlink" title="The Ten Best Video Conferencing Software That Provide Screen Sharing Options"></a>The Ten Best Video Conferencing Software That Provide Screen Sharing Options</h2><p>Even though each video conferencing software we included in this article can be used for free, some of the services offer only a limited set of options on their free versions. This means that the number of participants or the maximum duration of a group meeting can be restricted.</p><p>Purchasing a subscription plan is your only option if you want to be able to use all tools these video conferencing services have to offer. Here are the ten best video conferencing software products that provide screen sharing features.</p><h3 id="1-GoToMeeting"><a href="#1-GoToMeeting" class="headerlink" title="1.

You can use this app directly from your web-browser, on your Smartphone or Macs and PCs. The free version of GoToMeeting includes the screen sharing feature and it provides webcam support.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gotomeeting-screen-sharing.jpg"                      alt=" GoToMeeting Screen Sharing options"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997717/19272" target="_top" id="1997717">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997717" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997717/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Sharing a screen with GoToMeeting is a simple process that can be completed in just a few easy steps regardless of the device you’re using. However, if you opt for the free version of this video conferencing service you won’t be able to host meetings that have more than three participants. Furthermore, the maximum duration of a group meeting is limited to just forty minutes which makes the free version of GoToMeeting a good option just for individuals and small businesses. If you want to have access to unlimited cloud recording, automatic transcription or keyboard and mouse sharing options you will have to purchase the Business or Enterprise subscription model.</p><h3 id="2-Zoom"><a href="#2-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="2.

Moreover, the platform doesn’t limit the number of meetings you can host, although hosting meetings that are longer than forty minutes is not possible on the free version of Zoom.</p><p>As a host of a Zoom meeting, you can enable one or more participants to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >share screens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> simultaneously.

In addition, you can use a number of devices such as the Cisco Webex Board, room or desk devices for your presentations and meetings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/webex-screen-sharing.jpg"                      alt=" Share Screen on Cisco Webex"                ></p><p>Screen sharing is just one among countless options you will have at your disposal if you opt for the free version of Cisco Webex since this video conferencing service enables you to choose between different view outlines, create personal rooms or share files without any limitations. What’s more, you can host an unlimited number of meetings that can last for as long as you want, because there are no restrictions regarding the maximum duration of a meeting. The screen sharing feature is available even on the Cisco Webex mobile app so that you can share your device’s screen even if you are attending a meeting from you phone.</p><h3 id="4-Skype"><a href="#4-Skype" class="headerlink" title="4. Skype"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://www.skype.com/en/" >Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, iOS, Android</p><p>Skype is probably one of the oldest applications that provides video call services to its users for nearly two decades. Besides offering video chat and messaging tools, Skype also allows you to organize conference calls with up to fifty participants. All you need to do in order to create a conference call on Skype is to generate a call link with a single click and then share the invitations with the participants who can join the call via the unique link you send to them.</p><p>Each participant in a conference call can share their screen at any point in the meeting which makes the collaboration between different team members easier. You can record all your conference calls and Skype is going to store them for an entire month before deleting them. However, Skype offers fewer options than most video conferencing services, since you can’t schedule meetings in advance, create private rooms or adjust the meeting’s settings.</p><h3 id="5-Apache-OpenMeetings"><a href="#5-Apache-OpenMeetings" class="headerlink" title="5. Apache OpenMeetings"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://openmeetings.apache.org/" >Apache OpenMeetings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, Linux, Ubuntu</p><p>This open-source software is equipped with a broad range of video conferencing tools that enable you to schedule meetings, send instant messages or even edit documents. The maximum number of participants in a meeting depends on the type of meeting you select since you can create conference rooms with up to 32 participants, webinars with up to a hundred attendees or interviews that can’t include more than two persons.</p><p>It is hardly surprising that Apache OpenMeetings allows its users to share screens during video calls because the software is stacked with features that can potentially make the collaboration between team members more productive. In addition, you can record all video conferences you organize with this software, although you can only store footage on your local hard drive. Apache OpenMeetings is far from easy to use, and you are going to need some coding experience in order to optimize the software in accordance with your needs.</p><h3 id="6-Join-Me"><a href="#6-Join-Me" class="headerlink" title="6. Join.Me"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://www.join.me/" >Join.Me <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, pricing plans start at $10 per month</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, iOS, Android</p><p>Even though hosting meetings on Join.Me used to be free, the company discontinued the free version of the software a little over a year ago. Currently, you can only host a meeting on Join.Me if you purchase a monthly subscription, but participants don’t have to pay a fee in order to attend a meeting.</p><p>In case you opt for the least expensive Lite subscription model you will be able to host meetings that have up to five participants, although the webcam streaming option is not going to be available. The screen and window sharing feature is available within all subscription models, which means that you can use this collaboration tool regardless of the pricing plan you choose. None of the subscription models offered by Join.Me limits the maximum number of meetings you can have in one month or their duration. However, if you want to get access to recording features or store your videos online you will have to opt for the Pro or Business subscription plan.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148637/16836" target="_top" id="2148637">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148637" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148637/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Google-Hangouts"><a href="#7-Google-Hangouts" class="headerlink" title="7.

Although Google Hangouts isn’t necessarily the first option that comes to mind when video conferencing platforms are mentioned, the app is still a reliable choice for anyone who wants to host a video meeting.</p><p>What’s more Google Hangouts is equipped with screen sharing features which makes it a perfect collaboration tool for small and medium-sized teams. The best part is that like most of Google’s apps, Google Hangouts is completely free. However, the app is not without limitations, so you shouldn’t expect to find any advanced video conferencing options offered by Zoom or GoToMeeting. Even so, Google Hangouts offers a quick solution if you want to host an online meeting without having to go through the software installation process.</p><h3 id="8-TeamViewer"><a href="#8-TeamViewer" class="headerlink" title="8.

It is commonly used by customer support teams to provide assistance to users who are experiencing difficulties with a software product, but you can also use it to transfer large files, print documents remotely or install applications on a Smartphone or a computer.</p><p>Furthermore, you can install <a class="link"   href="https://www.blizz.com/en/" >Blizz TeamViewer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to schedule meetings that have up to 300 participants, record your meetings or enable members of your team to share their screens during meetings. The platform enables you to set up a meeting with a single click, while it also offers the HD VoIP option that allows you to reach your clients and colleagues wherever they are. Even though TeamViewer and Blizz TeamViewer can be downloaded for free, you must purchase a subscription plan in order to use all of the features they have to offer.</p><h3 id="9-FreeConference"><a href="#9-FreeConference" class="headerlink" title="9.

Setting up a video conference is an intuitive process that won’t take more than a few moments of your time.</p><p>However, the free version of FreeConference doesn’t allow you to host meetings that have more than five participants. Each participant can share their screen easily regardless of the pricing plan you have, while they can also communicate via chat throughout the meeting. Conference calls that are not hosted over the Internet can have up to a hundred participants and you can have an unlimited number of calls if you are calling local numbers. Online whiteboard, document sharing or SMS entry are also the options you’re going to have at your disposal if you choose the free version of the FreeConference software. Keep in mind that audio and video recording options are not going to be available unless you purchase a conferencing plan.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135395/19272" target="_top" id="2135395">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135395" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135395/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="10-Lifesize-Video-Conferencing"><a href="#10-Lifesize-Video-Conferencing" class="headerlink" title="10.

The maximum number of participants is limited to 25, although you can host up to 300 participants if you purchase one of the available subscription plans.</p><p>Unlike other video conferencing services that provide HD video quality, Lifesize Video Conferencing offers support for 4K video meetings, although this option is only available within Plus and Enterprise pricing plans. Unsurprisingly, sharing a screen during a meeting is remarkably easy as you just have to click on the Present button and decide if you want to share the entire screen or just an application window. Recording a meeting is not possible with the free version of the software, while the scheduling options leave much to be desired regardless of the pricing model.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>A simple feature like screen sharing can make a world of difference for your team’s productivity, as it enables the participants in a meeting to present their ideas or collaborate on a document effortlessly. This feature is included in the free version of most video conferencing software products you can find on the market, which means that the participants of the meetings you host are going to be able to share their screens even if you don’t purchase a subscription plan.

Here are the top 11 best streaming audio recorders.</p><p>We often come across certain songs that we want to download and listen to them in repeat without consuming the internet data pack.
