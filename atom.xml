Because of its name, it may seem to be a complex program, although it is quite popular among Windows users. This utility is also compatible with games that use OpenGL or DirectX graphics. When it comes to FRAPS, many things raise the standard, but the competition it provides to its counterparts while remaining affordable is unrivaled. Older versions of Windows, such as Windows XP, are also supported by FRAPS. This function is exceptional since it is not available in any other screen recorder. It is, on the other hand, simple to use and has a fluid drag-and-drop feature that elevates it to the top of the hierarchy.</p><p>Fraps is one of the most well-known third-party programs for PC gamers, thanks to its free and simple benchmarking features that can test the performance of almost any game. It’s also a simple method to put a frame rate counter in the corner of your screen to keep an eye on in-game performance second by second. FRAPS can capture up to 7680 x 4800 at bespoke frame rates ranging from 1 to 120 frames per second, making it stand out among its peers. Skype calls from online or video games are among the features available. It can also record sounds through a microphone, making it the most versatile of all the options thus far. There is no way to capture webcam footage or create a timeline. It also can’t add video titles or capture audio from the system. None of these drawbacks, we believe, are relevant to video game recording fans. FRAPS has numerous drawbacks despite its low cost and flexibility.</p><h2 id="1-Download-and-Install"><a href="#1-Download-and-Install" class="headerlink" title="1. Download and Install"></a>1. Download and Install</h2><p>Fraps can also record videos of your gaming sessions, but unlike the other tools in our overview of gameplay capture software, you must pay to use the program’s full video recording features. Minimized start, always on top view, show status on LCD, minimize to system tray exclusively, and more options are available under Fraps’ general settings. Games that utilize OpenGL and DirectX technologies are compatible with the system.</p><p>DOWNLOAD LINK: <a class="link"   href="https://fraps.com/" >FRAPS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="2-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Fraps"><a href="#2-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Fraps" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Record Screen with Fraps"></a>2. How to Record Screen with Fraps</h2><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> When you first launch Fraps, you’ll see that there isn’t much to it. There are four tabs in this little window: General, FPS, Movies, and Screenshots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fraps.jpg"                      alt="fraps"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Fraps’ benchmarking tools are located under the FPS tab. When Fraps is active, the framerate counter is always visible in-game. If you want to record a benchmark while playing, just press F11, but first adjust the benchmarking parameters under FPS &gt; Benchmark Settings to your desire.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fps.jpg"                      alt="fps"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118314/7443" target="_top" id="2118314">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118314" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118314/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> Stop the recording, then go to the Movies tab to see how Fraps is recording your game. Some choices are accessible in the free version, while others are not. The loop buffer length is deactivated, which allows you to use the hotkey to record the latest “X” seconds of gameplay. You may, however, choose whether you want a full-size or half-size recording and select the maximum frame rate when recording. You may also change the sound capture settings, record your microphone, hide or show the mouse pointer, lock the framerate while recording, and capture lossless RGB.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/movies.jpg"                      alt="movies"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006919/19272" target="_top" id="2006919">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006919" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006919/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#3-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="3.

When using Frap Screen Recorder to record, the quality of the recording degrades by roughly 13%. It may create lag and sluggish progress on their computer, and the reason for this may be due to the game’s high settings; thus, the game should be adjusted to the lowest level and played at a lower resolution. Fraps Screen Recorder does not fulfill your demands, which is one of the reasons you are seeking a solution. Yes, I see why. Fraps Screen Recorder is a unique screen recording application. Filmora Screen Recorder is another choice for Fraps Screen Recorder.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue (Mac) joins the Kinesis keyboard family with its easy-to-use modular design. Better yet, this ergonomic keyboard supports up to three connected devices at a time, allowing you to easily swap between a Mac, iPhone, or iPad with the press of a few hotkeys. With its compact build, the Kinesis Freestyle2 is a welcome addition to any Apple user’s collection, whether they’re at home or on the go, thanks to the excellent battery life of up to 300 plus hours of extended use.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-ergonomic-keyboards-4147386" >The Best Ergonomic Keyboards of 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Freestyle2-breaks-the-mold"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Freestyle2-breaks-the-mold" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Freestyle2 breaks the mold"></a><strong>Design and Features: Freestyle2 breaks the mold</strong></h2><p> For people who are tethered to their<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/computer-and-laptop-reviews-4102643" >computers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , ergonomic keyboards are a must. These keyboards tend to be large thanks to the frequently employed swoop design that opens up the keys to provide additional spacing, so fingers feel less cramped, and a wrist-friendly position that prevents<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/game-play-and-streaming-4781449" >repetitive stress injuries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> while typing. These keyboards are typically space hogs, taking up large portions of any surface that they’re placed on, often forcing users to reach further for<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-wireless-mice-6666207" >mice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This can lead to shoulder injuries in place of wrist injuries—a trade-off no one wants.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/C-YK_WPWu8Ujx1fwDLxvO6Epi-w=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kinesis_ErgoKeyboard_1LW4147386_05-adcddc5fc05b415dbcd82396bc0ada77.jpg"                      alt="Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue (Mac)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> The Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue for Mac breaks free of these norms by using a split, modular design that features two keyboard halves, one for each hand, connected via a 9 or 20-inch cable depending upon the chosen model. These pieces were designed with comfort in mind. They may be used separately or connected with a pivot tether at the top of the two halves. This allows you the opportunity to customize your setup and maximize your comfort, whether that’s by placing the halves closer together or further apart.</p><p> The Freestyle2’s minimum size is 15.4 inches in length, but it can extend to a maximum length of 23.5 inches (37.75 inches for the 20-inch model). It uses a standard key layout, so it’s familiar and easy to adjust to, while the low-impact design means that the keys need less pressure to type and are quieter. Additionally, its backside is free of risers letting your wrists sit in a neutral, comfortable position that helps prevent injuries over time.</p><p> Once charged, the battery life can last up to 300-plus hours of regular use.</p><p> Clocking in at 2 pounds, it’s also lightweight which makes it easy to pack. Whether you’re commuting between the home and the office or you’re heading out of town for a vacation, it’s easy to break down and bring anywhere so long as there’s a flat surface to place it during use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012406/19272" target="_top" id="2012406">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012406" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012406/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-For-Apple-products-only"><a href="#Setup-Process-For-Apple-products-only" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: For Apple products only"></a><strong>Setup Process: For Apple products only</strong></h2><p> The Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue arrives with the two keyboard halves, the instructional pamphlet, and a six-foot USB charging cable. Designed for use with iPads,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/iphone-and-ios-4781515" >iPhones <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/macs-4781332" >Macs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , the setup process is quick and easy to complete. First, we flipped the switch on the right-hand side of the keyboard from the off position to the on position. Then, we flipped the keyboard over and pressed the connect button on the backside. We knew it was ready to begin pairing when the lights on the frontside began flashing blue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/XHY6Xe9cdaO1U6Uj0wDY6rROlcA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kinesis_ErgoKeyboard_1LW4147386_04-7fad98b589454e0388ecf48afe425e8c.jpg"                      alt="Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue (Mac)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><p> From here, we followed the instructions in the provided instructional pamphlet and enabled Bluetooth on our iPad. After about a minute of scanning, the Kinesis KB800MB-BT keyboard appeared as an available device. We simply tapped to connect. From here, it prompted us to input a numeric code and press return. Once we’d done this, setup was complete.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137393/7443" target="_top" id="2137393">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137393" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137393/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Features-Efficient-hotkeys-once-you-get-used-to-them"><a href="#Features-Efficient-hotkeys-once-you-get-used-to-them" class="headerlink" title="Features: Efficient hotkeys once you get used to them"></a><strong>Features: Efficient hotkeys once you get used to them</strong></h2><p> Better than its modular design are the easy-to-use hotkeys on the left-hand side of the keyboard. These make it simple to copy, paste, cut, go back or forward in a browser, or even switch between the keyboard’s connected devices smoothly and efficiently. They take a little getting used to but once you get the hang of it using them is a breeze.</p><p> One pet peeve we had with the keyboard design was the Caps lock key. Instead of having a light on the button itself that glows when the function is enabled, this light is placed alongside the Bluetooth connectivity lights on the right-hand side of the keyboard. While this isn’t the end of the world by any means, it’s less intuitive since you need to retrain yourself on where to look to see if it’s enabled. Additionally, you should be aware that leaving this button on or using it frequently can lead to faster battery drain.</p><p> Its split design is comfortable, following the natural arc of your fingers and hands as they rest upon its keys.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148636/16836" target="_top" id="2148636">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148636" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148636/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Battery-Plenty-of-juice-so-you’re-never-in-a-bind"><a href="#Battery-Plenty-of-juice-so-you’re-never-in-a-bind" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Plenty of juice so you’re never in a bind"></a><strong>Battery: Plenty of juice so you’re never in a bind</strong></h2><p> The battery life on the Freestyle2 is excellent. It arrives with a partial charge, so it’s important to remember to fully charge it after receiving it. Once charged, the battery life can last up to 300 plus hours of regular use. The Freestyle2 does an excellent job of letting you know when its battery is getting low—battery lights will flash red to indicate when there are about four hours of battery life remaining. This ensures you’re never left hanging.</p><h2 id="Price-Excellent-for-the-features"><a href="#Price-Excellent-for-the-features" class="headerlink" title="Price: Excellent for the features"></a><strong>Price: Excellent for the features</strong></h2><p> Full-size ergonomic keyboards tend to retail anywhere from $50 to $200, depending on the features involved. Generally retailing for about $100 on Amazon, the Freestyle2 sits comfortably at the front of this curve. While $100 may seem expensive for a keyboard, consider the features involved. Its travel-friendly build, adjustable setup options, extended battery life, and ability to switch quickly and smoothly between multiple connected devices make it an excellent choice for the features.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/vncgu0FEgBJ69UL6H8BjQ2QoGRI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kinesis_ErgoKeyboard_1LW4147386_03-9055476d1d974c8bbe9b1c39d479b300.jpg"                      alt="Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue (Mac)"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Kinesis-Freestyle2-Blue-vs-Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Keyboard"><a href="#Kinesis-Freestyle2-Blue-vs-Microsoft-Sculpt-Ergonomic-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue vs. Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard"></a><strong>Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue vs. Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard</strong></h2><p> Not all keyboards are created equal, and while the split, modular design offered by the Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue creates wonderful customization options, there’s something to be said for having a full keyboard. For Apple users willing to take a leap into Microsoft products, the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard shines through as an excellent option.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-sculpt-ergonomic-keyboard-review-4780274" >Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> While it may seem odd to lean into Microsoft products for Mac lovers, its split design is comfortable, following the natural arc of your fingers and hands as they rest upon its keys. It also arrives with a mouse and detached numpad, which are some nice perks as the Freestyle2 doesn’t include the numpad, although it is available as an accessory for an additional $40. The Windows key may also be mapped to the command key on the Sculpt. Generally retailing for about $80-$120, the Sculpt is around the same price as the Kinesis.</p><p> Clocking in at 2 pounds, it’s also lightweight which makes it easy to pack.</p><p> One drawback to this device is that the receiver dongle used to pair the Sculpt to your computer is associated with the keyboard at the factory. This is because the keyboard features encryption technology in order to protect your keystrokes. If this dongle is lost, there simply is no replacing it. With this information in mind, this keyboard would do best in an environment where it stays put rather than the Freestyle2 which is much more travel-friendly thanks to its compact nature and Bluetooth pairing capabilities.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An ideal keyboard for Apple users with its compact design, portability, and long-lasting battery.</strong></p><p> The Kinesis Freestyle2 Blue for Mac is a compact, user-friendly ergonomic keyboard that takes comfort and customization to the next level for Apple users thanks to its split, modular design.

This Android OS was released in 2013, and it is the first OS for Android Smartphones that enabled its users to create screen recordings, although only via the Android Developer SDK, with the help of Android Debug Bridge. Furthermore, this option only works if the device is connected to a computer, and you also need to have access to the phone’s Developer mode.</p><p>One year after the KitKat OS was introduced to the public Google developed a new version of the Android OS, popularly named Lolipop, which allowed users to record their Smartphone’s screen with an app. The name Lollipop refers to versions 5.0 and 5.1.1 of the Android OS, and in February 2018, 24,6% of all Android devices accessing Google Play had the Lollipop OS. The more recent versions of Android OS, like Android ‘Marshmallow’, also provide support for screen recording apps.</p><p>If you have Lollipop or Marshmallow OS installed on your Android Smartphone, you can use the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rivulus.screenrecording&hl=en" >Lollipop Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app, although plenty more screen recording apps are available on the Google Play. Let’s have a look at the steps you’ll need to take in order to figure out how to record your screen on your Android phone with Lollipop Screen Recorder.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Download-and-install-Lollipop-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#Step-1-Download-and-install-Lollipop-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Step 1  Download and install Lollipop Screen Recorder"></a>Step 1  Download and install Lollipop Screen Recorder</h4><p>Open the Google Play application on your phone and search for the Lollipop Screen Recorder app. You can download it for free, so after the installation of the app is complete, launch it and proceed to adjust the settings for your screen recording session.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Fine-tuning-the-settings"><a href="#Step-2-Fine-tuning-the-settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Fine-tuning the settings"></a>Step 2 Fine-tuning the settings</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Lollipop Screen Recorder features only three settings, that let you choose whether you want to shoot in Landscape or Portrait mode, change the resolution of the video recording and enable the audio recording feature.</p><p>It is important to pay attention to the size of the file you are producing, especially if you want to send it to someone because if you pick the maximum Recording Resolution, the video file of your screen recording is going to be huge. Tutorials in which you show how an app is used or how to fix a certain problem on an Android Phone can benefit from the Record Microphone Audio option because it will enable you to explain the steps with your voice.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Recording-the-screen-of-an-Android-device"><a href="#Step-3-Recording-the-screen-of-an-Android-device" class="headerlink" title="Step 3  Recording the screen of an Android device"></a>Step 3  Recording the screen of an Android device</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder-start-recording.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Now that you’ve adjusted all the settings for a screen recording session, you should click on the circular icon located in the upper right corner of the app.</p><p>After you tap on the icon a message will pop up on the screen informing you that the app is about to start a new screen recording session. Check the Don’t show again checkbox and proceed to tap on the Start Now button. Once the screen recording session is in progress, you can leave the Lollipop Screen Recorder app and perform all activities you wanted to capture with your Android Smartphone.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Finishing-the-recording-session"><a href="#Step-4-Finishing-the-recording-session" class="headerlink" title="Step 4  Finishing the recording session"></a>Step 4  Finishing the recording session</h4><p>The app’s notification bar is going to be located at the top of the Smartphone’s screen, during the screen recording session, so in order to stop recording you simply need to find the notification with the label ‘Recording Screen’ and press stop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder-recorded-file.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Go back to the Lollipop Screen Recorder and you’ll be able to find the video file in the app’s main window. You can play the video directly from the Lollipop Screen recorder or you can share it to your Gmail account directly from the app. If you don’t like the screen recording you made, you can tap on the Delete button and start a new session.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Amazingly easy to use and it lets you capture videos in Portrait and Landscape modes.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Lollipop Screen Recorder can only capture screens in the device’s native resolution, and it doesn’t provide any customization options.</p><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Find out more video recorders for Android Phones and Tablets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><hr><h2 id="Part-2-Connecting-Your-Android-Devices-to-Windows-PC-or-Mac-to-Capture-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-Connecting-Your-Android-Devices-to-Windows-PC-or-Mac-to-Capture-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Connecting Your Android Devices to Windows PC or Mac to Capture Screen"></a>Part 2: Connecting Your Android Devices to Windows PC or Mac to Capture Screen</h2><p>Using an app to record the screen of your Android smartphone is just one method in which this task can be accomplished.

That doesn’t necessarily mean that you can’t record video with older android devices.<br>In such cases you can use android SDK to mirror the device’s display and record it using a desktop screen-capture software. Mirroring Software will enable you to record the screen on an Android device without rooting. You can use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-screen-mirror/" >Wondershare MirrorGo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> software to mirror cast the screen from your mobile phone to a display on your computer. Here’s how to record your screen on Android without rooting.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Install-Wondershare-MirrorGo"><a href="#Step-1-Install-Wondershare-MirrorGo" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Install Wondershare MirrorGo"></a>Step 1: Install Wondershare MirrorGo</h4><p>Start the process of setting up your screen recording session by downloading the MirrorGo Android recorder software for free from the manufacturer’s website. Launch the software and connect your Android Smartphone to the MirrorGo. You’ll be able to see the screen of your Android device on the PC’s screen. The software will synchronize all actions between two displays.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Record-the-Screen"><a href="#Step-2-Record-the-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Record the Screen"></a>Step 2: Record the Screen</h4><p>Locate the Android Recorder button, and click on it to commence the screen recording session.

Although they are frequently used to capture the gameplay of a video game, capture cards can also be used to capture a screen on an Android Smartphone.</p><p>These external video adapters let you connect the Android device and a computer, although you’ll have to spend some time to properly set up a screen recording session with a capture card. Some capture cards can cost as much as $200, so if you want to utilize this method to capture a screen on your Android Smartphone you should be prepared to invest money in such a project.</p><p>But the cost is the only downside of this otherwise very effective method of recording a screen on an Android device. The amount of options capture cards offer is staggering, but before you start recording a screen on your Smartphone you must make sure that you have the right hardware and software equipment.</p><p>What if this also doesn’t work for you? Don’t give up. You still stand a chance if your android device has an HDMI port. You can connect your device to a digital video camera and do the recording. Failing this, your solution will depend on a PC with HDMI PCI Express card or a USB HDMI adaptor powered with a suitable video capture software.</p><p>Sometimes you shouldn’t depend on installing apps. With the help of a ROM flasher, you can get a screen recorded included in your devices ROM. Therefore, if you already have a custom ROM running on your device, better to have a look if a screen recorder is installed. If so, it is a matter of activating it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983553">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983553.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983553">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983553.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983553%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983553/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-high-quality-8-android-video-callers-for-groups-above-four/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved High-Quality 8 Android Video Callers for Groups Above Four</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/ed-seamless-content-curation-with-youtubes-watch-later-feature/"><u>[Updated] Seamless Content Curation with YouTube’s Watch Later Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-expert-strategies-for-effective-gopro-time-lapse-footage/"><u>2024 Approved Expert Strategies for Effective GoPro Time-Lapse Footage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-record-a-webinar/"><u>2024 Approved How to Record a Webinar</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-uncharted-territory-6-secrets-to-documenting-your-minecraft-journey/"><u>2024 Approved Uncharted Territory 6 Secrets to Documenting Your Minecraft Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/a-detailed-review-top-10-screen-recorders-for-mac/"><u>A Detailed Review Top 10 Screen Recorders for Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/android-unlock-code-sim-unlock-your-infinix-smart-8-phone-and-remove-locked-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>Android Unlock Code Sim Unlock Your Infinix Smart 8 Phone and Remove Locked Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/enhance-filmmaking-on-iphone-top-camera-extensions-listed-for-2024/"><u>Enhance Filmmaking on iPhone Top Camera Extensions Listed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/expert-analysis-of-samsung-photo-editor-prospects-and-constraints/"><u>Expert Analysis of Samsung Photo Editor Prospects & Constraints</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-elite-portable-playstation-storage-best-external-units/"><u>In 2024, Elite Portable PlayStation Storage Best External Units</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-pro-mic-tech-review-best-9-online-recorders-uncovered/"><u>In 2024, Pro Mic Tech Review Best 9 Online Recorders Uncovered</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-video-editing-software-showdown-bandicam-vs-camtasia/"><u>In 2024, Video Editing Software Showdown Bandicam vs Camtasia</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-translation.techidaily.com/new-top-8-multi-subtitles-translators-you-can-use/"><u>New Top 8 Multi-Subtitles Translators You Can Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/pixelpunmatic-device-for-2024/"><u>PixelPunmatic Device for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/undelete-lost-contacts-from-tecno-spark-20-pro-by-fonelab-android-recover-contacts/"><u>Undelete lost contacts from Tecno Spark 20 Pro.</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

You can use this app directly from your web-browser, on your Smartphone or Macs and PCs. The free version of GoToMeeting includes the screen sharing feature and it provides webcam support.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gotomeeting-screen-sharing.jpg"                      alt=" GoToMeeting Screen Sharing options"                ></p><p>Sharing a screen with GoToMeeting is a simple process that can be completed in just a few easy steps regardless of the device you’re using. However, if you opt for the free version of this video conferencing service you won’t be able to host meetings that have more than three participants. Furthermore, the maximum duration of a group meeting is limited to just forty minutes which makes the free version of GoToMeeting a good option just for individuals and small businesses. If you want to have access to unlimited cloud recording, automatic transcription or keyboard and mouse sharing options you will have to purchase the Business or Enterprise subscription model.</p><h3 id="2-Zoom"><a href="#2-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="2. Zoom"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://zoom.us/" >Zoom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, pricing options start at $14.99 per month</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, web</p><p>In case you are looking for a video conferencing service that allows you to host meetings that have up to a hundred participants for free, then Zoom is the right choice for you. Moreover, the platform doesn’t limit the number of meetings you can host, although hosting meetings that are longer than forty minutes is not possible on the free version of Zoom.</p><p>As a host of a Zoom meeting, you can enable one or more participants to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >share screens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> simultaneously. The service also allows the host to disable this option entirely or to choose which participants can have access to this option during a meeting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-screen-to-share-on-zoom.jpg"                      alt=" Share Screen on Zoom"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105873/7443" target="_top" id="2105873">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105873" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105873/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Zoom cannot display more than 25 screens within the same window, which can limit your options if you are hosting a meeting with a large number of participants. You can<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record all of your meetings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to a local hard drive if you are using the Mac or PC version of Zoom, but you must upgrade to a paid version of Zoom if you want to store your recordings on the cloud.</p><p>Want to record the Zoom meeting but no permission yet, check some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best free screen recorder for Zoom Meetings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h3 id="3-Cisco-Webex"><a href="#3-Cisco-Webex" class="headerlink" title="3. Cisco Webex"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://www.webex.com/" >Cisco Webex <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, pricing plans start at $14.00 per month</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, iOS, Android</p><p>Entrepreneurs who want to host meetings with up to a hundred participants for free should consider using Cisco Webex. In addition, you can use a number of devices such as the Cisco Webex Board, room or desk devices for your presentations and meetings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/webex-screen-sharing.jpg"                      alt=" Share Screen on Cisco Webex"                ></p><p>Screen sharing is just one among countless options you will have at your disposal if you opt for the free version of Cisco Webex since this video conferencing service enables you to choose between different view outlines, create personal rooms or share files without any limitations. What’s more, you can host an unlimited number of meetings that can last for as long as you want, because there are no restrictions regarding the maximum duration of a meeting. The screen sharing feature is available even on the Cisco Webex mobile app so that you can share your device’s screen even if you are attending a meeting from you phone.</p><h3 id="4-Skype"><a href="#4-Skype" class="headerlink" title="4. Skype"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://www.skype.com/en/" >Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, iOS, Android</p><p>Skype is probably one of the oldest applications that provides video call services to its users for nearly two decades. Besides offering video chat and messaging tools, Skype also allows you to organize conference calls with up to fifty participants. All you need to do in order to create a conference call on Skype is to generate a call link with a single click and then share the invitations with the participants who can join the call via the unique link you send to them.</p><p>Each participant in a conference call can share their screen at any point in the meeting which makes the collaboration between different team members easier. You can record all your conference calls and Skype is going to store them for an entire month before deleting them. However, Skype offers fewer options than most video conferencing services, since you can’t schedule meetings in advance, create private rooms or adjust the meeting’s settings.</p><h3 id="5-Apache-OpenMeetings"><a href="#5-Apache-OpenMeetings" class="headerlink" title="5. Apache OpenMeetings"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://openmeetings.apache.org/" >Apache OpenMeetings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, Linux, Ubuntu</p><p>This open-source software is equipped with a broad range of video conferencing tools that enable you to schedule meetings, send instant messages or even edit documents. The maximum number of participants in a meeting depends on the type of meeting you select since you can create conference rooms with up to 32 participants, webinars with up to a hundred attendees or interviews that can’t include more than two persons.</p><p>It is hardly surprising that Apache OpenMeetings allows its users to share screens during video calls because the software is stacked with features that can potentially make the collaboration between team members more productive. In addition, you can record all video conferences you organize with this software, although you can only store footage on your local hard drive. Apache OpenMeetings is far from easy to use, and you are going to need some coding experience in order to optimize the software in accordance with your needs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118306/7443" target="_top" id="2118306">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118306" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118306/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Join-Me"><a href="#6-Join-Me" class="headerlink" title="6.

Currently, you can only host a meeting on Join.Me if you purchase a monthly subscription, but participants don’t have to pay a fee in order to attend a meeting.</p><p>In case you opt for the least expensive Lite subscription model you will be able to host meetings that have up to five participants, although the webcam streaming option is not going to be available. The screen and window sharing feature is available within all subscription models, which means that you can use this collaboration tool regardless of the pricing plan you choose. None of the subscription models offered by Join.Me limits the maximum number of meetings you can have in one month or their duration. However, if you want to get access to recording features or store your videos online you will have to opt for the Pro or Business subscription plan.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2044583/7443" target="_top" id="2044583">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2044583" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2044583/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Google-Hangouts"><a href="#7-Google-Hangouts" class="headerlink" title="7.

Although Google Hangouts isn’t necessarily the first option that comes to mind when video conferencing platforms are mentioned, the app is still a reliable choice for anyone who wants to host a video meeting.</p><p>What’s more Google Hangouts is equipped with screen sharing features which makes it a perfect collaboration tool for small and medium-sized teams. The best part is that like most of Google’s apps, Google Hangouts is completely free. However, the app is not without limitations, so you shouldn’t expect to find any advanced video conferencing options offered by Zoom or GoToMeeting. Even so, Google Hangouts offers a quick solution if you want to host an online meeting without having to go through the software installation process.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134503/19576" target="_top" id="2134503">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134503" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134503/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="8-TeamViewer"><a href="#8-TeamViewer" class="headerlink" title="8.

Each participant can share their screen easily regardless of the pricing plan you have, while they can also communicate via chat throughout the meeting. Conference calls that are not hosted over the Internet can have up to a hundred participants and you can have an unlimited number of calls if you are calling local numbers. Online whiteboard, document sharing or SMS entry are also the options you’re going to have at your disposal if you choose the free version of the FreeConference software.

Unsurprisingly, sharing a screen during a meeting is remarkably easy as you just have to click on the Present button and decide if you want to share the entire screen or just an application window. Recording a meeting is not possible with the free version of the software, while the scheduling options leave much to be desired regardless of the pricing model.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>A simple feature like screen sharing can make a world of difference for your team’s productivity, as it enables the participants in a meeting to present their ideas or collaborate on a document effortlessly. This feature is included in the free version of most video conferencing software products you can find on the market, which means that the participants of the meetings you host are going to be able to share their screens even if you don’t purchase a subscription plan.
