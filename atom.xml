But the best full screen recorder for Windows and Mac users is Wondershare Filmora where you can customize all recording parameters and edit your video like a pro.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-ultimate-gaming-screens-selecting-the-top-5-ps5/"><u>[New] In 2024, Ultimate Gaming Screens Selecting the Top 5 (PS5)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-balancing-bitrate-in-obs-broadcasts-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Balancing Bitrate in OBS Broadcasts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-choosing-between-obs-and-fraps-for-capture-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Choosing Between OBS and Fraps for Capture for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-essential-mac-apps-the-leading-alternatives-to-bandicam/"><u>[Updated] Essential Mac Apps The Leading Alternatives to Bandicam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-getting-started-with-vlc-screen-recordings-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Getting Started with VLC Screen Recordings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unlocking-youtube-secrets-to-effective-screen-recording/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unlocking YouTube Secrets to Effective Screen Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-cutting-edge-approaches-for-secure-and-precise-call-logging/"><u>2024 Approved Cutting-Edge Approaches for Secure and Precise Call Logging</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-fast-tracking-views-on-vimeo/"><u>2024 Approved Fast-Tracking Views on Vimeo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/2024-approved-precision-engagement-elevating-camera-angle-online/"><u>2024 Approved Precision Engagement Elevating Camera Angle Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-help.techidaily.com/barnes-and-nobles-newest-gem-the-enhanced-screen-display-of-nook-glowlight-plus-reviewed-here/"><u>Barnes & Noble's Newest Gem - The Enhanced Screen Display of Nook GlowLight Plus Reviewed Here!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/branding-beyond-words-eye-catching-podcast-graphics/"><u>Branding Beyond Words Eye-Catching Podcast Graphics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-remove-apple-id-from-apple-iphone-6-without-password-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Remove Apple ID from Apple iPhone 6 without Password?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-screen-recording-the-benefits-of-using-bandicam/"><u>In 2024, Mastering Screen Recording The Benefits of Using Bandicam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/pairing-devices-bonding-players-with-these-top-titles/"><u>Pairing Devices, Bonding Players with These Top Titles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-when-gps-fails-iphone-tips-and-tricks/"><u>Troubleshooting When GPS Fails: IPhone Tips and Tricks</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

This could only be done by jailbreaking the device or installing a third-party <strong>iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen recorder</strong>.</p><p>Another alternative was to connect your device to a Mac and use QuickTime to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen. This can be also troublesome as you can not carry a Mac along with you if you need to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad’s screen.</p><p>But all this has changed with the outcome of iOS 11. Apple has added a built-in mobile screen recorder. With the <strong>iPhone&#x2F;iPad built-in screen recorder</strong>, you no longer need to jailbreak your device or install third-party screen recorders.</p><p>So, in this article, we will show you how to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen whether your iOS device is running the latest iOS 11 and later versions or not.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Record Screen with Built-in Screen Recorder in iPhone&#x2F;iPad</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Use QuickTime to record iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen</a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/1995803/22899" target="_top" id="1995803">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-1995803" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/1995803/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Built-in-Screen-Recorder-in-iPhone-iPad-For-iOS-11-and-Later-Versions"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Built-in-Screen-Recorder-in-iPhone-iPad-For-iOS-11-and-Later-Versions" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Record Screen with Built-in Screen Recorder in iPhone&#x2F;iPad [For iOS 11 and Later Versions]"></a>Part 1: How to Record Screen with Built-in Screen Recorder in iPhone&#x2F;iPad [For iOS 11 and Later Versions]</h2><p> The iOS 11 has come with a built-in mobile screen recording feature, so if you’re running the iOS 11 and later iOS versions, you can use the free recording tool of iPhone directly. This built-in app has provided a great alternative to the traditional methods to record screen videos without the use of third-party apps for iOS users. The built-in screen recorder has made the whole process very easy and simple. Follow the steps mentioned below if you want to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad’s screen.</p><ol><li>If you don’t have a screen recorder toggle on the Control Center, you need to enable the Screen Recording feature in the Settings on your iPhone&#x2F;iPad. First, tap the Settings app, and then tap Control Center &gt; Customize Controls. Find <strong>Screen Recording</strong> then tap the green “+” button beside it to add the Screen Recording feature to Control Center.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/ios11.jpg"                      alt="ios 11"                ></p><ol><li>Open the Control Center by swiping up from the bottom of your iPhone&#x2F;iPad.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ios-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="ios screen recording "                ></p><ol><li>Tap the screen recording icon that looks like a solid circle enclosed in another circle.

In the following section, we will show you how to do it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Use-QuickTime-to-Record-Screens-of-iPhone-iPad-Version-Before-iOS-11"><a href="#Part-2-Use-QuickTime-to-Record-Screens-of-iPhone-iPad-Version-Before-iOS-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Use QuickTime to Record Screens of iPhone&#x2F;iPad (Version Before iOS 11)"></a>Part 2: Use <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/quicktime" >QuickTime <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to Record Screens of iPhone&#x2F;iPad (Version Before iOS 11)</h2><p>People need to download and install a third-party iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen recorder after jailbreaking the device and going through a complicated installation process. iOS is always risky to jailbreak your device as if you don’t do it carefully your device will get broken. It means your device will stop functioning and you will need to go to Apple care for getting it fixed. Jailbreaking also voids your warranty. So rather than going through these risks, people preferred using QuickTime to record their Phone&#x2F;iPad’s screen.</p><p>With QuickTime media player you could record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad’s Screen. For recording your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen with the help of QuickTime, you would need Mac OS X. Below are the steps to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen on your Mac by using QuickTime.</p><p>1. Connect your iOS device (iPhone&#x2F;iPad&#x2F;iPod touch) to your Mac with a USB cable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20logo.jpg"                      alt="quicktime"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123740/7443" target="_top" id="2123740">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123740" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123740/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>2. Launch QuickTime on your Mac available in the application folder.</p><p>3. Click on the File menu on the QuickTime menu bar and choose New Movie Recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20new%20moive.jpg"                      alt="quicktime"                ></p><p>4. A video recording screen will open. Now slide the cursor over that window to make the record and volume button visible.</p><p>5. Click on the arrow next to the red record button to show the camera and microphone recording options. Choose your device from the list of devices and you will be able to see your device screen in the QuickTime window.</p><p>6. Click on the red record button when you want to start recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20iphone.jpg"                      alt="quicktime screen recorder"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014849/22899" target="_top" id="2014849">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014849" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014849/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>7. To stop the recording of the screen of your iOS device, click on the Stop button at the video recorder window.</p><p>8. If you want to edit the video, you can do it in QuickTime (for basic editing). You can also save the recorded video first and then edit it later. You can directly save it as it is in QuickTime by going to File Menu and clicking on save option.</p><p>The recorded video will be saved in .mov file format which you can later export to view on certain devices. You can edit the video later in QuickTime, Wondershare Filmora, or others and share it online for tutorials or demonstration, and whatever you want to do with it. This method of recording the iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen is useful for devices running the iOS version lower than 11. This is a far safer method to record device screen video than jailbreaking. But with the addition of a mobile screen recorder app in iOS 11 and above, it seems a little bit clumsy by using QuickTime.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen recorder is a very useful tool when you want to record tutorials, demonstrations, or report bugs. The demand for mobile screen recorders is rapidly increasing. Youngsters also love recording funny clips and videos to share the video on social media networks and other platforms. So which method offered above is better, no definite answer. All you need to consider is your own situation.

Mainstreaming enables you to broadcast on Twitch and YouTube or stream on Twitch and Facebook, or all three! At the same time, with everyone spending more time indoors amid the global crisis, it appears we’re all seeking a diversion and many gamers are asking themselves how to broadcast on YouTube or Twitch. One of the easiest methods to broadcast on Twitch and YouTube Gaming at the same time is via OBS. Streamers may broadcast to more than 30 streaming platforms concurrently using an easy-to-understand user interface. The service is created in a manner that won’t place any demand on your PC hardware or the bandwidth you have available.</p><p>Well, it all boils down to choosing. But if you want to know the streaming networks with the highest traffic, those platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming. Twitch is a mainstreaming service that enables you to broadcast on more than 30 of your favorite platforms simultaneously. It merely takes a few minutes to join your numerous live streaming accounts and interact directly with the popular encoding program OBS. You may also multi streams on Twitch and your other favorite streaming services. Knowing what the correct gear is when you’re starting as a streamer may be intimidating, but we come with good news. Nowadays the entry-level for streaming has reduced quite a bit owing to hardware becoming more affordable, but also because many PCs are already prepared to manage a broadcast or can be readily updated to support one.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Stream-to-Twitch-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-Stream-to-Twitch-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Stream to Twitch with OBS"></a>Part 2: Stream to Twitch with OBS</h2><p>If you want to obtain the very greatest quality broadcast, you’re searching for some fantastic software. In the case of Windows, one of the most common solutions is Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) (OBS). Many people are first drawn to OBS since it’s free to use owing to being open source. Luckily, it’s also a feature-rich piece of software that can handle practically anything you throw at it. If you’re new to OBS or to streaming in general, it might be a bit frightening at first.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Getting-a-Stream-Key-from-Twitch"><a href="#Step-1-Getting-a-Stream-Key-from-Twitch" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Getting a Stream Key from Twitch"></a>Step 1. Getting a Stream Key from Twitch</h3><p>Before you stream anything anyplace, you need to provide OBS with the credentials to broadcast on your channel. Exactly how you do this on the large number of services OBS supports may differ, but I’m covering Twitch for this instruction.</p><p>In all circumstances, you need to either produce a stream key in your account settings on the appropriate provider or link your account to OBS if it’s supported like it is on Twitch. Simply signing in with your credentials is by far the simplest approach, and OBS utilizes streaming, so you’re not providing any of your personal login information directly to it. YouTube likewise offers a similar kind of authentication.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitch.jpg"                      alt="twitch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424529">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424529.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424529">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424529.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424529%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424529/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-2-Installing-and-Setting-OBS"><a href="#Step-2-Installing-and-Setting-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Step 2. Installing and Setting OBS"></a>Step 2. Installing and Setting OBS</h3><p>OBS Studio is available for all main operating systems such as Windows, Mac OS, and, Linux. You may get the utility by clicking here. Run and install the software to get started. When you launch the program for the first time, OBS Studio performs an Auto-Configuration Wizard. It provides you the choice of selecting between ‘Optimize for streaming’ and ‘Optimize for recording’. Click on the ‘Optimize for streaming’ if you wish to live broadcast your game. The wizard will next examine your system’s performance. It examines and helps adjust your system resolution, bitrate, encoder, and internet connection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/installing-and-setting-obs.jpg"                      alt="installing and setting obs"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2139322/26400" target="_top" id="2139322">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2139322" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2139322/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-3-Configuring-OBS-Studio-for-Streaming-to-Twitch"><a href="#Step-3-Configuring-OBS-Studio-for-Streaming-to-Twitch" class="headerlink" title="Step 3. Configuring OBS Studio for Streaming to Twitch"></a>Step 3. Configuring OBS Studio for Streaming to Twitch</h3><p>Now that you’re set up to the stream, the first step is to select your resolution, frame rate, and bitrate. The greater each of them, the more bandwidth and horsepower you’ll require from your PC. If you’ve got a high-speed internet connection and a strong PC, then you can probably stream at 1080p60 at a high bitrate. But you also need to balance this with offering a stream that’s not going to buffer like wild for your viewers who could be on poorer connections. Remember, if you’re not a partner on Twitch, you won’t have transcoding, thus the experience might be awful for viewers with sluggish connections.</p><p>Once you’re done setting up OBS, you can dig into the advanced capabilities such as OBS sceneries. These will allow you to dramatically boost your live stream production value. If you arrange your OBS scenes and sources appropriately, your broadcast may go from an ordinary-looking stream to one that appears slick and professional.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configuring-obs-studio.jpg"                      alt="configuring obs studio"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135373/19272" target="_top" id="2135373">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135373" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135373/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135411/19272" target="_top" id="2135411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135411/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-4-Adding-Scene-and-Sources"><a href="#Step-4-Adding-Scene-and-Sources" class="headerlink" title="Step 4.

Once you have chosen this, you will simply be prompted to pick a name for the scene. All of your overlays, sources, and basic on-screen items will need to be introduced through a specified scene. Once you have created your scene and titled it, make sure it is chosen and proceed to the box on the right side of the picture below to click the plus symbol. This brings up the many sources you may pick from for your freshly constructed scenario.

Adding a Twitch Chat</h3><p>Adding your twitch chat to your broadcasts may help make your viewers feel more included by enabling them to see their message live on the screen. You may add your Twitch chat box to your live broadcast in OBS by utilizing the browser source. The best practice when employing a chat box is to make sure to have your visuals, displays, and overlays set up to accommodate it. Get the widget URL from your favorite provider and copy it to your clipboard. This is what you will be adding to your OBS sources to add the chat to your overlay. If you’re using Twitch, this will be provided to you once you pick your basic settings for your chat style and layout. In the “Sources” section of OBS, go to the “+” in the bottom left corner, and pick, “Browser” to create a new browser source window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twitch-chat.jpg"                      alt="twitch chat"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132162/7443" target="_top" id="2132162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132162/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Stream-to-YouTube-with-OBS"><a href="#Part-3-Stream-to-YouTube-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Stream to YouTube with OBS"></a>Part 3: Stream to YouTube with OBS</h2><p>You may get it by browsing OBS Studio’s official website.

The actual steps you’ll need to take may vary, depending on the computer and the OS you are using, and we are going to show you how to extend displays on Windows 8 or later.</p><p>Head over to the Start Menu, and open the Control Panel.

The plug-in for the OBS called Simple Scene Switcher that detects on which monitor the mouse cursor is and that automatically switches between two monitors as you drag a mouse is a great option if you don’t want to record multiple displays at the same time. The plug-in lets you switch between windows without disrupting the flow of the video, which makes it particularly useful for LoL players and in numerous other situations. Here’s how you can record multiple monitors with OBS.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Adding-a-Second-Display-1"><a href="#Step-1-Adding-a-Second-Display-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 - Adding a Second Display"></a>Step 1 - Adding a Second Display</h4><p>Once you launch the software, you should use the right-click to access the software’s drop-down menu. Locate the Add feature and select the Display Capture option. Create&#x2F;Select Source window will pop-up, hit OK and once the Properties window appears on screen you should select your second monitor form the Display drop-down list. A new screen will emerge on the screen, and you can simply drag it to reposition it where you want.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Adjusting-the-Resolution-1"><a href="#Step-2-Adjusting-the-Resolution-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 - Adjusting the Resolution"></a>Step 2 - Adjusting the Resolution</h4><p>Go to OBS Studio’s main window and click on the Settings button in the lower right corner of the window. Select the Video option from the Settings menu, and then expand the Base (Canvas) Resolution bar.</p><p>Sum up the two values of the wider sides of the screens and insert the value you get into the Base Resolution bar. For example, if one monitor has a 1366X768 resolution and the second one has a 1024X768 resolution, you should add 1024 to the 1366 and insert the resulting value (2390) as the wide resolution value in Base Resolution Bar.</p><p>Save the changes you’ve made, and then drag the screens to arrange them. You can start recording multiple monitors with OBS Studio by clicking on the Start Recording button.</p><h3 id="Capturing-Multiple-Monitor-Displays-with-Camtasia-1"><a href="#Capturing-Multiple-Monitor-Displays-with-Camtasia-1" class="headerlink" title="Capturing Multiple Monitor Displays with Camtasia"></a>Capturing Multiple Monitor Displays with Camtasia</h3><p>Selecting more than one monitor from the Camtasia’s Fullscreen settings is unfortunately not possible, but the Custom recording settings option allows you to capture footage from two different displays. You’ll need to make sure that both monitors are properly aligned and the that Extend These Displays feature is selected.

Now you only have to reset the UI so it can recognize the changes you’ve made, and you can do it by inserting the <strong>killall SystemUIServer</strong> command into the Terminal window and pressing Enter to execute it.</p><p>Don’t forget that deleting the folder you use as a default location for storing screenshots should only be done using the process we just described in the Terminal application, since all other methods may cause unnecessary trouble.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-operate-srt-audio-on-windowsmacos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Operate SRT Audio on Windows/macOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-accessing-the-latest-events-streaming-facebook-live-through-roku/"><u>[New] Accessing the Latest Events Streaming Facebook Live Through Roku</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-capturing-your-digital-world/"><u>[New] Capturing Your Digital World</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-exploring-dells-bold-move-with-the-latest-p2715q-monitor-review-for-2024/"><u>[New] Exploring Dell's Bold Move with the Latest P2715Q Monitor Review for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-from-novice-to-pro-your-journey-with-the-io-screener/"><u>[New] From Novice to Pro Your Journey with the IO Screener</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/astering-your-youtube-live-video-thumbnail-game/"><u>[New] Mastering Your YouTube Live Video Thumbnail Game</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-premium-mac-recorder-for-crystal-clear-audio-and-hd-video-for-2024/"><u>[New] Premium Mac Recorder for Crystal Clear Audio & HD Video for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-reinstating-lost-sound-output-in-obs-recordings/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Reinstating Lost Sound Output in OBS Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-perfectly-capture-audio-remotely/"><u>[Updated] How to Perfectly Capture Audio Remotely</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-webcam-recording-made-simple-for-laptops-and-chromebooks/"><u>[Updated] Webcam Recording Made Simple for Laptops & Chromebooks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-no-fuss-guide-to-recording-virtual-classes-on-windowsmacos/"><u>2024 Approved No-Fuss Guide to Recording Virtual Classes on Windows/macOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/2024-approved-step-by-step-guide-for-seamless-sending-of-large-videos-from-iphones/"><u>2024 Approved Step by Step Guide for Seamless Sending of Large Videos From iPhones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/has-gpt-transformed-the-landscape-of-college-writing-projects/"><u>Has GPT Transformed the Landscape of College Writing Projects?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/hasty-yet-stunning-the-quick-path-to-perfect-collage-pics-for-2024/"><u>Hasty, Yet Stunning The Quick Path to Perfect Collage Pics for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/in-2024-evaluating-magix-samplitudes-market-position-against-other-audio-editing-suites/"><u>In 2024, Evaluating MAGIX Samplitudes Market Position Against Other Audio Editing Suites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/navigating-the-sony-handheld-gaming-world/"><u>Navigating the Sony Handheld Gaming World</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Enhance-Visuals-with-Better-OBS-Settings"><a href="#Enhance-Visuals-with-Better-OBS-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Enhance Visuals with Better OBS Settings"></a>Enhance Visuals with Better OBS Settings</h2><p>When you are live streaming through OBS Studio, encoding the video takes a lot of CPU resources. If you do not have a high-end computer, you are likely to face Encoding Overloaded issue while using OBS Studio. High encoding problem is rather common in OBS Studio because video recording and streaming demand high system resources which your computer is unable to meet.</p><p>In layman’s terms, encoding overloading means your hardware is just not running as fast as required to process the video you are streaming or recording. Since you cannot change your hardware configuration overnight, here are the different ways you can fix OBS high encoding when streaming.</p><h2 id="Way-1-Downscale-Your-Output-Resolution"><a href="#Way-1-Downscale-Your-Output-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Downscale Your Output Resolution"></a>Way 1. Downscale Your Output Resolution</h2><p>The higher the resolution of the video recording or streaming, the greater will be the CPU usage. This is because your processor has to process more number of pixels per frame. That is why you have to lower the output resolution of your video. Even when your base resolution is high, you have to cut down the output resolution. Base resolution is the resolution of the video at source which could be the game you are playing. The output resolution is the resolution of the video you are getting after recording or you are streaming in real-time. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Select Video tab. You will have to look for Output (Scaled) Resolution option.</p><p>Step 3: You have to reduce the resolution from the current resolution. If it is at 1920 x 1080p, you have to bring it down to 1280 x 720p.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Apply and Ok buttons. Restart your computer and start streaming or recording again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-reduce-the-output-resolution.jpg"                      alt="obs reduce the output resolution"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137412/7443" target="_top" id="2137412">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137412" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137412/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Way-2-Lower-Your-Frame-Rate"><a href="#Way-2-Lower-Your-Frame-Rate" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Lower Your Frame Rate"></a>Way 2. Lower Your Frame Rate</h2><p>The frame rate of a video determines the number of frames captured per second. The higher the frame rate, the greater will be the pressure on GPU to render more number of frames per second. Unless you have a powerful configuration, you will come across OBS high encoding when streaming if the frame rate is high such as 60FPS. Here are the steps to lower the frame rate of your video on OBS.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Video tab and look for Common FPS Values option.</p><p>Step 3: If it is set to 60, you have to bring it down to 30. Basically, you have to reduce the current value.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Apply and Ok button to save the new setting. Restart your computer and resume your OBS operation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-click-on-apply-and-ok-button.jpg"                      alt="obs click on apply and ok button"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130529/26400" target="_top" id="2130529">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130529" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130529/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123482/16836" target="_top" id="2123482">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2123482" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123482/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Way-3-Change-Encoder-Preset"><a href="#Way-3-Change-Encoder-Preset" class="headerlink" title="Way 3. Change Encoder Preset"></a>Way 3. Change Encoder Preset</h2><p>By default, OBS uses x264 as encoder and the encoder preset is set to “veryfast”. This is generally the best and most balanced setting. However, if you are getting OBS high encoding warning, you have to change the encoder preset to reduce the CPU usage. Generally, the higher the preset, the lower is CPU usage. Therefore, you have to set the preset from “veryfast” to “ultrafast” and here are the steps.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Output tab and make sure that the encoder is Software(x264).</p><p>Step 3: Turn on Enable Advanced Encoder Settings option.</p><p>Step 4: Change the Encoder Preset from Veryfast to Ultrafast.</p><p>Step 5: Click on Apply and Ok button. Restart your computer and perform your action on OBS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-change-encoder-preset.jpg"                      alt="obs change encoder preset"                ></p><h2 id="Way-4-Try-Hardware-Encoding"><a href="#Way-4-Try-Hardware-Encoding" class="headerlink" title="Way 4. Try Hardware Encoding"></a>Way 4. Try Hardware Encoding</h2><p>You can try out different hardware encoders available such as Quicksync, AMF, or NVENC. The availability of different hardware encoders depends on your computer hardware configuration. These hardware encoders are better than the default x264 encoder as they use less CPU resources. Since the issue is primarily with encoder, you should try changing the encoder and see if the problem is fixed.</p><p>Step 1: On OBS, you will have to go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Select Output tab and set Output Mode to Advanced.</p><p>Step 3: Go to Streaming tab, and check all the encoders available.</p><p>Step 4: Change the encoder from default x264 to any other hardware encoder available.</p><p>Step 5: Click on Apply and Ok to save the settings. Restart your computer and perform your operation on OBS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-restart-your-computer-and-perform-your-operation.jpg"                      alt="obs restart your computer and perform your operation"                ></p><h2 id="Way-5-Change-Some-Advanced-Settings"><a href="#Way-5-Change-Some-Advanced-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Way 5. Change Some Advanced Settings"></a>Way 5. Change Some Advanced Settings</h2><p>If you are still facing OBS high encoding problem, you need to change some advanced settings in order to fix this encoder overloaded issue. You can change the keyframe interval so that your processor gets enough time for rendering. Similarly, you can change Rate Control from Constant to Variable so that the video does not demand high bandwidth.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Output tab and set Output Mode as Advanced.</p><p>Step 3: From Streaming tab, change Keyframe Interval and set it to 2 from zero.</p><p>Step 4: Change Rate Control from CBR to VBR.</p><p>Step 5: Change Profile from None to Main.</p><p>Step 6: Click on Apply and Ok button to save the changes. Restart your computer and check if the problem is resolved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-open-and-go-to-settings.jpg"                      alt="obs open and go to settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1304648">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304648.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1304648">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304648.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1304648%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1304648/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118312/7443" target="_top" id="2118312">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118312" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118312/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Way-6-Use-OBS-Alternative"><a href="#Way-6-Use-OBS-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="Way 6.

Here’s how you can convert a PowerPoint presentation to video if you are still using PowerPoint 2007.</p><p>Before you proceed any further you’ll have to make sure that you have <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Windows Movie Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> installed on your PC. Afterward, you should save each slide you included in your presentation as an image file, preferably in the JPG file format. You can do this by clicking on the File menu. then opening the Save As submenu and choosing the Other Formats option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-ppt-to-video-ms2007.jpg"                      alt="Save PPT to Videos"                ></p><p>When all the slides are saved as images, you should launch the Windows Movie Maker and import all images you previously created in PowerPoint. If you want to include narration in your PowerPoint video, you can import the audio file directly into the Windows Movie Maker and add it to your project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-ppt-to-video-ms2007-windows-movie-maker.jpg"                      alt="Save PPT to Videos"                ></p><p>This method of saving a PowerPoint presentation as a video doesn’t allow you to keep animations, transitions or multimedia files, because you have to convert all slides into image files.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118313/7443" target="_top" id="2118313">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118313" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118313/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Saving-PowerPoint-2010-Presentation-as-Video-1"><a href="#Part-2-Saving-PowerPoint-2010-Presentation-as-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Saving PowerPoint 2010 Presentation as Video"></a>Part 2: Saving PowerPoint 2010 Presentation as Video</h2><p>Unlike the previous version of the software, PowerPoint 2010 actually features an option that enables you to convert the PPT file into a video file format.

Please note that if you have a 2013 PowerPoint and you want to save a PPT file created on the 2007 version of the software you can do so by clicking on the Create a Video option. Here’s how you can convert a PowerPoint presentation to video if you are still using PowerPoint 2007.</p><p>Before you proceed any further you’ll have to make sure that you have <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Windows Movie Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> installed on your PC.

However, sometimes it is not enough to arrange slides in a PowerPoint presentation, because PPT files this iconic software produces are not easily shared on social media. What’s more, saving your presentations as video files will enable you to protect them from unauthorized use and it will allow you to include them in your eLearning courses or online marketing campaigns.</p><p>That’s the reason why we decided to show you how you can save your PowerPoint presentations on 2016, 2013, 2010 and 2007 versions of PowerPoint on both Windows and Mac OS.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1:Save PowerPoint 2007 Presentations as Video on Windows OS</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Saving a PowerPoint 2010 Presentation as a Video</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Save a PowerPoint 2013 or 2016 Presentation as a video on Windows OS</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Saving PowerPoint Presentation as video on Mac OS</a></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132162/7443" target="_top" id="2132162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132162/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136548/16384" target="_top" id="2136548">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136548" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136548/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp;

Please note that if you have a 2013 PowerPoint and you want to save a PPT file created on the 2007 version of the software you can do so by clicking on the Create a Video option. Here’s how you can convert a PowerPoint presentation to video if you are still using PowerPoint 2007.</p><p>Before you proceed any further you’ll have to make sure that you have <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Windows Movie Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> installed on your PC.

It organizes the musical audio and video files by copying them to Apple products such as iPad, iPod, and iPhone. Well, most of us modern generation want to know of other ways to record iTunes videos through different ways. In this context, there are a lot of applications that claim to record iTunes videos but it’s not recommended to opt for one before knowing from a source based on research.</p><p>Coming to the crux, you don’t have to worry about going to the internet and finding one to know how you can record videos from iTunes but through this article, we will let you know every step that you should utilize to record videos from iTunes.

Related FAQs"></a>Part 3. Related FAQs</h2><p><strong>Does Spotify let you screen record?</strong></p><p>No, Spotify does not let you screen record. This is because if they allow screen record, the recordings will get distributed across the world for free. Spotify holds the license for distribution and free distribute will hurt the business. Therefore, Spotify offers no option for screen recording. However, premium Spotify users can download any track and listen offline only through Spotify.</p><p> <strong>How do I record a stream on Spotify?</strong></p><p>The only way to record a stream on Spotify is by using a Spotify recorder. If you are using Spotify on your smartphone, you will need Spotify recorder Android and iOS, respectively. If you are using Spotify on your computer, you will need Spotify recorder Windows and Mac, respectively. Once you have installed Spotify audio recorder, you need to get the settings perfect on the application and hit the Record button. Start the track that you want to record, and once the recording is over, hit the Stop button.<br>The Bottom Line</p><p>There is no option available to record a stream on Spotify. If you are a premium Spotify user, you can download them to listen to them offline. However, the downloaded files are protected in such a way that you can play them through Spotify only.

Related FAQs"></a>Part 3. Related FAQs</h2><p><strong>Does Spotify let you screen record?</strong></p><p>No, Spotify does not let you screen record. This is because if they allow screen record, the recordings will get distributed across the world for free. Spotify holds the license for distribution and free distribute will hurt the business. Therefore, Spotify offers no option for screen recording. However, premium Spotify users can download any track and listen offline only through Spotify.</p><p> <strong>How do I record a stream on Spotify?</strong></p><p>The only way to record a stream on Spotify is by using a Spotify recorder. If you are using Spotify on your smartphone, you will need Spotify recorder Android and iOS, respectively. If you are using Spotify on your computer, you will need Spotify recorder Windows and Mac, respectively. Once you have installed Spotify audio recorder, you need to get the settings perfect on the application and hit the Record button. Start the track that you want to record, and once the recording is over, hit the Stop button.<br>The Bottom Line</p><p>There is no option available to record a stream on Spotify. If you are a premium Spotify user, you can download them to listen to them offline. However, the downloaded files are protected in such a way that you can play them through Spotify only. Therefore, if you are a free user and you want to record any track, you need an audio recorder for Spotify. Among free ones, Free Sound Recorder is the best.

Related FAQs</h2><p><strong>Does Spotify let you screen record?</strong></p><p>No, Spotify does not let you screen record. This is because if they allow screen record, the recordings will get distributed across the world for free. Spotify holds the license for distribution and free distribute will hurt the business. Therefore, Spotify offers no option for screen recording. However, premium Spotify users can download any track and listen offline only through Spotify.</p><p> <strong>How do I record a stream on Spotify?</strong></p><p>The only way to record a stream on Spotify is by using a Spotify recorder. If you are using Spotify on your smartphone, you will need Spotify recorder Android and iOS, respectively. If you are using Spotify on your computer, you will need Spotify recorder Windows and Mac, respectively. Once you have installed Spotify audio recorder, you need to get the settings perfect on the application and hit the Record button. Start the track that you want to record, and once the recording is over, hit the Stop button.<br>The Bottom Line</p><p>There is no option available to record a stream on Spotify. If you are a premium Spotify user, you can download them to listen to them offline. However, the downloaded files are protected in such a way that you can play them through Spotify only. Therefore, if you are a free user and you want to record any track, you need an audio recorder for Spotify. Among free ones, Free Sound Recorder is the best. But for premium quality recording, we recommend Wondershare Filmora that comes with a plethora of features and functionalities.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-picks-and-tips-for-thriving-in-valheim/"><u>[New] In 2024, Top Picks & Tips for Thriving in Valheim</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/ed-dissecting-youtubes-user-commentary-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Dissecting YouTubes' User Commentary for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-optimized-auditory-experience-choosing-the-best-audio-device/"><u>[Updated] Optimized Auditory Experience Choosing the Best Audio Device</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-resolving-face-swap-glitches-in-facebook-chat-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Resolving Face Swap Glitches in Facebook Chat for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-the-elite-selection-of-stardew-customizations-and-updates-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Elite Selection of Stardew Customizations and Updates for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-understanding-the-process-of-altering-photo-genders-on-social-networks-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Understanding the Process of Altering Photo Genders on Social Networks for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/edit-and-send-fake-location-on-telegram-for-your-tecno-spark-go-2023-in-3-ways-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Edit and Send Fake Location on Telegram For your Tecno Spark Go (2023) in 3 Ways | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/professional-editing-techniques-for-obs-studio-success/"><u>Professional Editing Techniques for OBS Studio Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/resolving-the-dreaded-dark-a-comprehensive-guide-on-repairing-windows-11s-black-screen-problem/"><u>Resolving the Dreaded Dark: A Comprehensive Guide on Repairing Windows 11'S Black Screen Problem</u></a></li><li><a href="https://os-tips.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-setting-up-automatic-repeat-alerts-on-your-ios-devices/"><u>Step-by-Step Guide: Setting up Automatic Repeat Alerts on Your iOS Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/stepwise-guide-to-ipad-time-lapse-mastery/"><u>Stepwise Guide to iPad Time-Lapse Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/trasforma-le-immagini-a-bassa-qualita-con-winxvideo-ai-ottimizzazione-per-la-riproduzione-in-full-hd-ultra-hd-e-oltre/"><u>Trasforma Le Immagini a Bassa Qualità Con Winxvideo AI - Ottimizzazione per La Riproduzione in Full HD, Ultra HD E Oltre</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/unleashing-the-potential-choose-best-6-android-apps-for-windows-11/"><u>Unleashing the Potential: Choose Best 6 Android Apps for Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/watchnetflix-screenshare-master-screenrecording-on-macos/"><u>WatchNetflix, Screenshare Master ScreenRecording on MacOS</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Moreover, nowadays all the lectures are delivered online from classrooms such as zoom, google classroom but the problem with these platforms is that theydon’tt record the provided lectures.</p><p>Another thing is that most of the teachers want to have perfect applications to record their screen records to edit whereas many screen records are available which can even record and lively draw, write and edit that recording. So these are some of the most common uses of screen recorders by teachers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115919/19272" target="_top" id="2115919">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115919" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115919/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-features-a-screen-recorder-for-teaching-should-have"><a href="#Part-2-What-features-a-screen-recorder-for-teaching-should-have" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What features a screen recorder for teaching should have?"></a>Part 2: What features a screen recorder for teaching should have?</h2><p>Before the teacher opts for a certain screen recorder to use he must know some of the basic points to consider in screen recorder. In this section, we will discuss those screen recorders.</p><p>Easy-to-use: The first and foremost thing that teachers should consider about a screen recorder application is its interface complexity. In other words, the screen recorder that he will use should be user-friendly. Since most of the teachers don’t have a software background therefore user-friendly applications are recommended for them.</p><p>Cursor effects: Other important features that a screen recorder should have are cursor effects. Since teachers usually provide lectures and need to point out many things on the screen and write different stuff to guide their students therefore it is always best to use a screen recorder having cursor effects.</p><p>Annotation tools: We know that during delivering lectures the teacher must need tools that can draw, write and comment on a particular section on the screen. Since teachers always provide information this way they must use screen recorders that are equipped with different annotation tools.</p><p>Webcam recording: Since most of the teachers provide lectures online therefore they also need to record them through screen recorders. However, while providing lectures it’s important that during recording the webcam of the teacher should also be recorded to be seen on the providing lectures. This ensures full communication between the students and teachers.</p><p>Customizable recording area: Many recorders cannot record a certain area on the screen therefore for teachers it should be avoided in the first place. While recording lectures it’s always necessary for teachers to record a certain area on the screen and leave the rest so screen recorders that have customizable recording areas are strongly recommended to teachers.</p><p>Great video quality: Last and the important factor that should be considered in screen recorders required for teachers is the quality of the recording. Since delivering lectures about important matters the video must contain the small details in perfect quality to avoid confusion when it is watched later. So for teachers, it is important to choose a recorder that records in the finest quality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1374820">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1374820.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1374820">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1374820.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1374820%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1374820/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Best-screen-recorder-for-teaching"><a href="#Part-3-Best-screen-recorder-for-teaching" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Best screen recorder for teaching"></a>Part 3: Best screen recorder for teaching</h2><p>In this section, we will some of the best screen recorders that are perfect for teaching.
