The 4K Pro is the first mass-market 4K webcam in the world. It is also loaded with extra features to produce beautiful videos, far surpassing the needs of most users. Although Skype and Messenger users might not find the 4K Pro cost-effective ($199!) tech enthusiasts and pro-streamers will. Because what the 4K Pro offers is a glimpse into the 4K future!</p><p>In this article we will provide a comprehensive review of this Logitech 4K webcam, breaking it down to the essentials, so you can decide if this is the gadget for your YouTube streaming or video recordings.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Hardware Specification Glimpse</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Logitech 4K Webcam Design Review</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Picture and Sound Quality Test</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Logitech 4K Webcam main features</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Logitech 4K Webcam Recording Capabilities Test</a></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitech-4k-pro-webcam.jpg"                      alt=" Logitech 4K Webcam "                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Logitech’s-4K-Pro-camera-Hardware-Specification"><a href="#Part-1-Logitech’s-4K-Pro-camera-Hardware-Specification" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Logitech’s 4K Pro camera Hardware Specification"></a>Part 1: Logitech’s 4K Pro camera Hardware Specification</h2><p>The Logitech 4K Pro features <strong>4K Ultra HD streaming up to 4096 x 2160 pixels at 30 FPS</strong>. It also streams 1080p Full HD at either 30 FPS or 60 FPs and 720p HD at 30, 60 and 90 FPS. This range of options is essential because, without a monitor that supports 4K Ultra HD, you won’t be able to use the 4K Pro’s 4K capabilities. <strong>Logitech’s RightLight 3 with HDR</strong> further enhances the video, allowing for streaming in various lighting environments ranging from direct sunlight to low-light.</p><p>It also has <strong>plug-and-play capabilities</strong>, with USB 2.0 Type A and USB 3.0 Type A and C connectivity. It has the best out-of-the-box settings we’ve seen in a webcam. However, to get the most out the 4K Pro you need to <strong>download the Logitech Camera Settings app from Logitech’s website</strong>. The app makes available all the 4K Pro’s camera controls such as pan and 5x digital zoom in Full HD as well as the ability to calibrate brightness, contrast and white balance. It also lets you choose between standard and widescreen displays or change the field of view (FOV) from 90 degrees to 78 or 65 degrees.</p><p>The Logitech also has a <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Background Replacement Feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>, enabled through a separate download, and <strong>built-in dual omnidirectional mics with automatic background noise cancellation</strong>.</p><p>The camera’s system requirements are Windows 7 (1080p only), Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and masOS 10.10 or higher. For Chromebooks, it requires Version 29.0.1547.70, Platform 4319.79.0 with a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Dual Processor and 2 GB of RAM.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Compact-Design"><a href="#Part-2-Compact-Design" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Compact Design"></a>Part 2: Compact Design</h2><p>The 4K Pro manages to fit all those features into a slim design. <strong>It’s just</strong> <strong>4 x 1.1 x 1.1-inches</strong>. Because of its aluminium casing, it is also light, weighing just two ounces. The 4K Pro’s layout is simple, with the 4K lens in the centre between the two omnidirectional, noise-cancelling microphones.</p><p>The unit is mounted to a rubber-coated flexible arm that can clip onto the top of a laptop or flat-screen monitor. The rubber arm allows the camera to be tilted and contorted for greater customisation. <strong>Unfortunately, the 4K Pro’s mount is a step-down in build quality from the C920 and C922</strong>. Logitech’s webcams usually have some of the best clips in the business, because they are made of hard plastic that locks them tight against your screen. The 4K Pro’s arm takes a little getting used to and it can wobble and even fall off if you’re not careful. However, I can understand why Logitech made the change. The 4K Pro’s arm is detachable and reveals a square plastic piece on the bottom of the stand which folds out, allowing the camera to stand freely on any flat surface. Alternatively, the stand can be removed to place the camera on a tripod mount.</p><p><strong>The 4K Pros 4.9-feet cable is also detachable</strong>, so you can replace it with a more compatible connector of your choosing. There are two accessories included with the 4K Pro. A plastic privacy shutter that clips over the camera unit with a small-hinged flap that can be lowered over the lens when you’re not using it. As well as a microfiber drawstring bag to transport the 4K Pro in.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-is-the-Picture-and-Sound-Quality-recorded-by-Logitech-4K-Webcam"><a href="#Part-3-How-is-the-Picture-and-Sound-Quality-recorded-by-Logitech-4K-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How is the Picture and Sound Quality recorded by Logitech 4K Webcam?"></a>Part 3: How is the Picture and Sound Quality recorded by Logitech 4K Webcam?</h2><p><strong>There’s no question Logitech’s 4K Pro takes the best-looking pictures out of all the external webcams on the market</strong>. Its unparalleled quality is enhanced by Logitech’s RightLight 3 with HDR technology, allowing it to adjust to all lighting environments; whether it be under fluorescent lighting or natural light. Recordings are wide-screen, with real-to-life colours and sharp details. <strong>Thanks to the wide 90-degree lens, it also captures more of the background then its competitors</strong>. However, as mentioned in the specifications section, you have to download the Logitech Camera Settings App to unlock all the 4K Pro’s features.</p><p><strong>The dual omnidirectional microphones produce crystal clear sound</strong>. The automatic background noise-cancellation worked well in all environments and the recorded audio was nice and loud.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-effective-are-the-main-features-of-the-4K-Webcam"><a href="#Part-4-How-effective-are-the-main-features-of-the-4K-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How effective are the main features of the 4K Webcam?"></a>Part 4: How effective are the main features of the 4K Webcam?</h2><p>As mentioned in the specifications section, there’s an optional Background Replacement Feature, which is powered by Personify. The feature is in its beta stage, which is why it’s not built into the app. Instead, you need to download an extra driver to get it to work. <strong>But despite being in beta, the Background Replacement Feature works really, really well</strong>.</p><p>There’s a cool new feature, which I have not seen on other webcams, that blurs the background to keep out the details you might want to keep hidden! The Chromakey pre-set green-screen background is <strong>great for game streaming on Twitch or YouTube</strong>.</p><p><strong>The 4K Pro also uses an infrared camera to support facial recognition to log in via Windows Hello</strong>. This is such a cutting-edge and exciting feature and it worked well regardless of the lighting environment.</p><p>Also, once you have downloaded the Logitech Camera Settings App it is very easy to customise your videos. The multiple field-of-vision options and 5x digital zoom allow you to take control of the shot and are fantastic integrations for video-conferencing.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2044585/7443" target="_top" id="2044585">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2044585" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2044585/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-How-About-the-4K-Webcam-Recording-Capabilities"><a href="#Part-5-How-About-the-4K-Webcam-Recording-Capabilities" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How About the 4K Webcam Recording Capabilities?"></a>Part 5: How About the 4K Webcam Recording Capabilities?</h2><p><strong>Right now, there aren’t many ways you can use the Logitech 4K Pro at its full 4K resolution.</strong> The issue is that 4K Ultra HD has yet to make the kind of impact in the online market that it has in home entertainment. The most popular video-chatting apps, including Google Hangouts and Skype for Business, don’t support 4K. <strong>You’ll also need a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4k Monitor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to truly appreciate the picture</strong> and if who you’re chatting to online doesn’t have one, then they’ll only see you in 1080p. You can stream 4K videos to YouTube if you have enough bandwidth. Besides the 4K monitors, you may also need a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >webcam recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that has the ability to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record 4K videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> too, such as Filmora <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Screen Recorder Software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><strong>The RightLight 3 with HDR functionality does mean that you will get the sharpest, most accurate videos out there</strong>. But until the software and hardware that support 4K are widely available the ultra-high-resolution aspect of the camera will not be immediately useful.</p><p>Therefore, you should get the Logitech 44K Pro takes the best shots you’ll get right now if you can put-up with the mount which is a huge step down from previous models. But right now, there’s limited usability for such a futuristic webcam and Logitech makes cheaper alternatives that can shoot HD videos, such as the C920 and the C922.K Pro Webcam if you’re a YouTuber who wants to live stream super-sharp videos at the highest resolution possible. Or, if you’re a forward-thinking type and have the budget to get ahead of the curve.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868571/19272" target="_top" id="1868571">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868571" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868571/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Virtual-Vice-Versa-10-Alternative-Action-Games"><a href="#Virtual-Vice-Versa-10-Alternative-Action-Games" class="headerlink" title="Virtual Vice-Versa: 10 Alternative Action Games"></a>Virtual Vice-Versa: 10 Alternative Action Games</h2><p>Understandably, you may be looking for other games like GTA if you’ve enjoyed being in Los Santos and Blaine County, but find that things are getting stale. Despite Rockstar’s continued tease of GTA 6, most of us have already experienced that world since 2013. We’ve collected a few of our favorite GTA-inspired substitutes for you to enjoy in the meantime. We’ve compiled 10 games like GTA V to keep you occupied until we find out what’s next for the series.</p><h3 id="1-Red-Dead-Redemption-2"><a href="#1-Red-Dead-Redemption-2" class="headerlink" title="1.Red Dead Redemption 2"></a>1.Red Dead Redemption 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/red-dead-redemption-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="red-dead-redemption-2-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p>The same studio makes both the GTA series and Red Dead, so you can probably guess why that one’s here. As with its predecessor, Red Dead Redemption 2 has an open world that feels alive, and it never says away from including interesting details. Following an outlaw gang who hopes to pull one last heist before retiring, it is primarily a story of trust and betrayal. The story is not as simple as it seems, and many unexpected twists and turns are revealed. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a great game if you like GTA 5 with a Wild West theme and revolver weapons. Its setting is reminiscent of GTA’s belief in player freedom. If you’re in the mood for a Grand Theft Auto experience, Red Dead Redemption 2 is well worth your time.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Visuals and voice acting is incredible.</p><p>• Side quests and main missions that will thrill you.</p><p>• Many side distractions that are both ludicrous and delightful.</p><p>• You feel like you have gone back a century.</p><h3 id="2-Assassin’s-Creed-Origins"><a href="#2-Assassin’s-Creed-Origins" class="headerlink" title="2.Assassin’s Creed Origins"></a>2.Assassin’s Creed Origins</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/assassins-creed-origins-poster.jpg"                      alt="assassins-creed-origins-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows, Google Stadia</p><p>The Assassin’s Creed series has increasingly emphasized open-world gameplay, making it a great choice for GTA 5 fans. You’ll find plenty of fun to be had with its vast world that is three times larger than Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. There are dungeons and pyramids to explore so that you won’t get bored.</p><p>As well as this, it has a great story that offers a refreshing change of pace from the assassin-focused theme of the original series. In some historical accuracy, Aya and Bayek, who collaborate with Cleopatra to become the first assassins, are depicted by Assassin’s Creed Origins. Even though Origins does not have a modern theme like GTA 5, it still offers excellent graphics and gameplay that will keep fans entertained.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Visually stunning and the soundtrack matches it.</p><p>• The world has gone mad.</p><p>• Combat is outstanding.</p><p>• The best part of the Assassin’s Creed History.</p><h3 id="3-Watch-Dogs-2"><a href="#3-Watch-Dogs-2" class="headerlink" title="3.Watch Dogs 2"></a>3.Watch Dogs 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/watchdogs-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="watchdogs-2-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms</strong>: PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p>Ubisoft took this criticism to heart when developing Watch Dogs 2, which was criticized as a sour-hearted affair. In this regard, Rockstar’s new game straddles a much closer line between contemporary Grand Theft Auto games and its own setting for a biting satire. From Grand Theft Auto 5, do you remember the mission “Life Invaders”? It’s pretty cool to use bungee-corded pool balls as weapons. This is essentially what Watch Dogs 2 is like, but blown up into an entire game. Despite Watch Dogs 2’s parody of Silicon Valley, Rockstar’s still packs a punch that Ubisoft’s doesn’t, but anyone who has ever had to watch an Apple conference or a Facebook ad will laugh no end.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• An entertaining and strong mission design.</p><p>• There is a lot to see and do in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>• Hack into any electronic device.</p><p>• The concept is very similar to GTA V but it is more of a tech genre game.</p><h3 id="4-Saints-Row-The-Third"><a href="#4-Saints-Row-The-Third" class="headerlink" title="4.Saints Row: The Third"></a>4.Saints Row: The Third</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/saintsrow-the-third-poster.png"                      alt="saintsrow-the-third-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, Xbox One, Switch, PS3, Xbox 360</p><p>Initially, Saints Row was an obvious ripoff of GTA, desperately trying to copy Rockstar’s style. In the end, it was a mediocre effort that garnered a cult following for two games but failed to make a lasting impression. Saints Row: The Third, in contrast, took note of how grim and serious games like GTA were becoming, said “f that,” and made them ridiculous.</p><p>You play as a group of friends so widely known and loved that you rob a bank dressed as novelty costumes of yourselves. Players will face a small-scale zombie apocalypse, make various decisions that matter, and fight with a three-foot-long dildo bat as a melee weapon. Many GTA-like games get stuck in their own self-importance, but Saints Row just stays as silly as possible. Although this is an older game, it has backward compatibility on Xbox One and was ported to Nintendo Switch in 2019, so it is a great excuse to revisit the Saints once again.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Activities that are absurd and surreal.</p><p>• Plot twists that will make your head spin.</p><p>• The world has a tremendous amount of depth.</p><p>• Driving and combat models that are simple.</p><h3 id="5-Just-Cause-4"><a href="#5-Just-Cause-4" class="headerlink" title="5.Just Cause 4"></a>5.Just Cause 4</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/just-cause4-poster.jpg"                      alt="just-cause4-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p>You, the player, have a lot of freedom in Just Cause 4, so you can achieve unprecedented levels of chaos. Don’t forget your wingsuit. Your grappling hook is ready. Cars that can be surfed as a massive tornado lifts them into the air. Just wait until you see what you can achieve in The Republic of Medici if the ragdoll physics amused you in GTA 5. In truth, Rockstar’s latest offering lacks the storytelling prowess of its signature franchise but instead excels at choreographing carnage on an epic scale.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• The abilities of Rico are immensely powerful.</p><p>• The setting is beautiful and varied.</p><p>• Extreme weather conditions are the essence of Just Cause.</p><p>• New gadgets can be experimented with on the physics system.</p><h3 id="6-Yakuza-0"><a href="#6-Yakuza-0" class="headerlink" title="6.Yakuza 0"></a>6.Yakuza 0</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/yakuza0-poster.jpg"                      alt="yakuza0-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4</p><p>With so many side activities to enjoy outside of the main campaign, Grand Theft Auto has always been praised for the way it brings cities to life. The design philosophy of Yakuza 0 is taken to its logical conclusion. Yakuza 0 joins the likes of Grand Theft Auto 5 with karaoke, pool, arcade games, wrestling, bowling, dancing, gambling, and… I think awkwardly viewing some explicit material in the back of a video store. Those last two can attest that not all side activities are tastefully done, but the sheer number and variety of options are astonishing. Compared to GTA, Yakuza has a much smaller scope, but what it lacks in quantity (quirky, offbeat) it makes up for in quality.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• It’s so diverse.</p><p>• Funny writing that is snappy and genuinely funny.</p><p>• There are some great sidequests.</p><p>• The storyline and main characters are good.</p><h3 id="7-Sleeping-Dogs"><a href="#7-Sleeping-Dogs" class="headerlink" title="7.Sleeping Dogs"></a>7.Sleeping Dogs</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sleeping-dogs-poster.jpg"                      alt="sleeping-dogs-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One, PS3, Xbox 360</p><p>In keeping with its name, Sleeping Dogs was a sleeper hit in 2012. Combining the action of B-movie stunt movies with the conventions of the open-world crime genre, it becomes a sleeper hit. With its garb of a classic Bruce Lee film, it feels like Grand Theft Auto dressed up as a classic video game. Unfortunately, Sleeping Dogs 2 was canned while still in its early stages of development, making it a rare gem that deserves to be appreciated for what it brought to the table. Sleeping Dogs was re-released in 2014 on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, so there’s really no excuse to let it remain unpurchased (sorry).</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Fights well drives well and runs well.</p><p>• A well-acted and told story.</p><p>• The game features fierce melee combat, an alluring atmosphere, and fun gunplay.</p><p>• You can find a variety of collectibles and enjoy many other diversions.</p><h3 id="8-The-Saboteur"><a href="#8-The-Saboteur" class="headerlink" title="8.The Saboteur"></a>8.The Saboteur</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-saboteur-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-saboteur-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Microsoft Windows, iOS, Xbox 360, BlackBerry, PlayStation 3</p><p>Taking the open-world game experience and tying it to a WWII setting makes The Saboteur a great game. With multiple realistic historical elements, it is set during the German occupation in France. Sean Devlin, an Irish cab driver who joins the resistance after the German soldiers kill his best friend, is the protagonist of The Saboteur.</p><p>Gameplay-wise, The Saboteur and GTA 5 have a lot in common. Both involve running around an open world, stealing cars, causing havoc, and evading the law. Gamers will be entertained for hours with The Saboteur’s interesting open-world gameplay and side-quests.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Action that moves quickly.</p><p>• Filter for black and white graphics.</p><p>• There is a vast world to discover in this game.</p><p>• Excellent sound design and a great story.</p><h3 id="9-Mafia-Definitive-Edition"><a href="#9-Mafia-Definitive-Edition" class="headerlink" title="9.Mafia: Definitive Edition"></a>9.Mafia: Definitive Edition</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mafia-definite-edition-poster.jpg"                      alt="mafia-definite-edition-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows</p><p>While Mafia: Definitive Edition lacks the open-world concept as much as fans would have liked, its mafia-themed story makes up for it.

In this regard, Rockstar’s new game straddles a much closer line between contemporary Grand Theft Auto games and its own setting for a biting satire. From Grand Theft Auto 5, do you remember the mission “Life Invaders”? It’s pretty cool to use bungee-corded pool balls as weapons. This is essentially what Watch Dogs 2 is like, but blown up into an entire game. Despite Watch Dogs 2’s parody of Silicon Valley, Rockstar’s still packs a punch that Ubisoft’s doesn’t, but anyone who has ever had to watch an Apple conference or a Facebook ad will laugh no end.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• An entertaining and strong mission design.</p><p>• There is a lot to see and do in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>• Hack into any electronic device.</p><p>• The concept is very similar to GTA V but it is more of a tech genre game.</p><h3 id="4-Saints-Row-The-Third-1"><a href="#4-Saints-Row-The-Third-1" class="headerlink" title="4.Saints Row: The Third"></a>4.Saints Row: The Third</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/saintsrow-the-third-poster.png"                      alt="saintsrow-the-third-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, Xbox One, Switch, PS3, Xbox 360</p><p>Initially, Saints Row was an obvious ripoff of GTA, desperately trying to copy Rockstar’s style. In the end, it was a mediocre effort that garnered a cult following for two games but failed to make a lasting impression. Saints Row: The Third, in contrast, took note of how grim and serious games like GTA were becoming, said “f that,” and made them ridiculous.</p><p>You play as a group of friends so widely known and loved that you rob a bank dressed as novelty costumes of yourselves. Players will face a small-scale zombie apocalypse, make various decisions that matter, and fight with a three-foot-long dildo bat as a melee weapon. Many GTA-like games get stuck in their own self-importance, but Saints Row just stays as silly as possible.

The design philosophy of Yakuza 0 is taken to its logical conclusion. Yakuza 0 joins the likes of Grand Theft Auto 5 with karaoke, pool, arcade games, wrestling, bowling, dancing, gambling, and… I think awkwardly viewing some explicit material in the back of a video store. Those last two can attest that not all side activities are tastefully done, but the sheer number and variety of options are astonishing. Compared to GTA, Yakuza has a much smaller scope, but what it lacks in quantity (quirky, offbeat) it makes up for in quality.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• It’s so diverse.</p><p>• Funny writing that is snappy and genuinely funny.</p><p>• There are some great sidequests.</p><p>• The storyline and main characters are good.</p><h3 id="7-Sleeping-Dogs-1"><a href="#7-Sleeping-Dogs-1" class="headerlink" title="7.Sleeping Dogs"></a>7.Sleeping Dogs</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sleeping-dogs-poster.jpg"                      alt="sleeping-dogs-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One, PS3, Xbox 360</p><p>In keeping with its name, Sleeping Dogs was a sleeper hit in 2012. Combining the action of B-movie stunt movies with the conventions of the open-world crime genre, it becomes a sleeper hit. With its garb of a classic Bruce Lee film, it feels like Grand Theft Auto dressed up as a classic video game. Unfortunately, Sleeping Dogs 2 was canned while still in its early stages of development, making it a rare gem that deserves to be appreciated for what it brought to the table. Sleeping Dogs was re-released in 2014 on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, so there’s really no excuse to let it remain unpurchased (sorry).</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Fights well drives well and runs well.</p><p>• A well-acted and told story.</p><p>• The game features fierce melee combat, an alluring atmosphere, and fun gunplay.</p><p>• You can find a variety of collectibles and enjoy many other diversions.</p><h3 id="8-The-Saboteur-1"><a href="#8-The-Saboteur-1" class="headerlink" title="8.The Saboteur"></a>8.The Saboteur</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-saboteur-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-saboteur-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Microsoft Windows, iOS, Xbox 360, BlackBerry, PlayStation 3</p><p>Taking the open-world game experience and tying it to a WWII setting makes The Saboteur a great game.

We tried our best to keep those titles in this list that are closely related to GTA 5 and offers similar gameplay experience. Although the dynamics of these games will be different compared to GTA 5, you will enjoy the gameplay.</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p>The same studio makes both the GTA series and Red Dead, so you can probably guess why that one’s here. As with its predecessor, Red Dead Redemption 2 has an open world that feels alive, and it never says away from including interesting details. Following an outlaw gang who hopes to pull one last heist before retiring, it is primarily a story of trust and betrayal. The story is not as simple as it seems, and many unexpected twists and turns are revealed. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a great game if you like GTA 5 with a Wild West theme and revolver weapons. Its setting is reminiscent of GTA’s belief in player freedom. If you’re in the mood for a Grand Theft Auto experience, Red Dead Redemption 2 is well worth your time.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Visuals and voice acting is incredible.</p><p>• Side quests and main missions that will thrill you.</p><p>• Many side distractions that are both ludicrous and delightful.</p><p>• You feel like you have gone back a century.</p><h3 id="2-Assassin’s-Creed-Origins-3"><a href="#2-Assassin’s-Creed-Origins-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Assassin’s Creed Origins"></a>2.Assassin’s Creed Origins</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/assassins-creed-origins-poster.jpg"                      alt="assassins-creed-origins-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows, Google Stadia</p><p>The Assassin’s Creed series has increasingly emphasized open-world gameplay, making it a great choice for GTA 5 fans. You’ll find plenty of fun to be had with its vast world that is three times larger than Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. There are dungeons and pyramids to explore so that you won’t get bored.</p><p>As well as this, it has a great story that offers a refreshing change of pace from the assassin-focused theme of the original series. In some historical accuracy, Aya and Bayek, who collaborate with Cleopatra to become the first assassins, are depicted by Assassin’s Creed Origins. Even though Origins does not have a modern theme like GTA 5, it still offers excellent graphics and gameplay that will keep fans entertained.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Visually stunning and the soundtrack matches it.</p><p>• The world has gone mad.</p><p>• Combat is outstanding.</p><p>• The best part of the Assassin’s Creed History.</p><h3 id="3-Watch-Dogs-2-3"><a href="#3-Watch-Dogs-2-3" class="headerlink" title="3.Watch Dogs 2"></a>3.Watch Dogs 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/watchdogs-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="watchdogs-2-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms</strong>: PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p>Ubisoft took this criticism to heart when developing Watch Dogs 2, which was criticized as a sour-hearted affair. In this regard, Rockstar’s new game straddles a much closer line between contemporary Grand Theft Auto games and its own setting for a biting satire. From Grand Theft Auto 5, do you remember the mission “Life Invaders”? It’s pretty cool to use bungee-corded pool balls as weapons. This is essentially what Watch Dogs 2 is like, but blown up into an entire game. Despite Watch Dogs 2’s parody of Silicon Valley, Rockstar’s still packs a punch that Ubisoft’s doesn’t, but anyone who has ever had to watch an Apple conference or a Facebook ad will laugh no end.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• An entertaining and strong mission design.</p><p>• There is a lot to see and do in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>• Hack into any electronic device.</p><p>• The concept is very similar to GTA V but it is more of a tech genre game.</p><h3 id="4-Saints-Row-The-Third-3"><a href="#4-Saints-Row-The-Third-3" class="headerlink" title="4.Saints Row: The Third"></a>4.Saints Row: The Third</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/saintsrow-the-third-poster.png"                      alt="saintsrow-the-third-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, Xbox One, Switch, PS3, Xbox 360</p><p>Initially, Saints Row was an obvious ripoff of GTA, desperately trying to copy Rockstar’s style. In the end, it was a mediocre effort that garnered a cult following for two games but failed to make a lasting impression. Saints Row: The Third, in contrast, took note of how grim and serious games like GTA were becoming, said “f that,” and made them ridiculous.</p><p>You play as a group of friends so widely known and loved that you rob a bank dressed as novelty costumes of yourselves. Players will face a small-scale zombie apocalypse, make various decisions that matter, and fight with a three-foot-long dildo bat as a melee weapon. Many GTA-like games get stuck in their own self-importance, but Saints Row just stays as silly as possible.

Frame drop is a common issue if you are using OBS Studio for recording high-end games or live streaming with high output resolution. You can easily understand about OBS drop frames while streaming when your viewers complain about lagging and stuttering.</p><p>In fact, you can even check OBS stream status to find out about OBS Studio drop frames. Dropping frames literally ruins the recording and hence, it needs to be fixed before further operation. You need to understand the reasons behind OBS losing frames and take actions accordingly to fix the issue. In this article, we will explain the reasons and provide all the possible solutions to prevent OBS dropping frames recording and streaming.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-OBS-Drops-Frames"><a href="#Part-1-Why-OBS-Drops-Frames" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why OBS Drops Frames?"></a><strong>Part 1. Why OBS Drops Frames?</strong></h2><p>OBS can drop the frame rate due to various reasons. When too many frames are dropped, the streaming server is disconnected. Dropped frames are one of the main causes which can affect streaming playback. Besides, a drop in frames leads to bad recording of screen and gameplay. Here are some of the reasons why OBS drops frames while recording or streaming.</p><ul><li>Your computer has an unstable internet connection.</li><li>Your computer has low-end hardware configuration.</li><li>Your video output resolution is very high.</li><li>Your video bitrate is very high.</li><li>Your internet upload speed is rather low.</li><li>antivirus or firewall is messing with OBS Studio.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Fix-OBS-Dropping-Frame"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Fix-OBS-Dropping-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How To Fix OBS Dropping Frame?</strong></h2><h2 id="Way-1-Update-OBS-Run-as-an-Administrator"><a href="#Way-1-Update-OBS-Run-as-an-Administrator" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Update OBS &amp; Run as an Administrator"></a>Way 1. Update OBS &amp; Run as an Administrator</h2><p>It is important to know that you are using the latest version of OBS. This helps to prevent encoding overload as well as problems due to stuttering. Make sure that you run OBS as an administrator. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Download and install the latest version of OBS Studio.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Start menu and search for OBS Studio.</p><p>Step 3: Right-click on the OBS icon and select Run As Administrator option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-run-as-an-administrator.jpg"                      alt="obs run as an administrator"                ></p><h2 id="Way-2-Reduce-The-Output-Resolution"><a href="#Way-2-Reduce-The-Output-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Reduce The Output Resolution"></a>Way 2. Reduce The Output Resolution</h2><p>When you reduce the resolution, the video quality gets lowered. But for smooth streaming and recording, you have no other option. When you reduce resolution, you require less CPU usage and less internet bandwidth. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 2: Select Video tab. You will see Base and Output resolution.</p><p>Step 3: You have to reduce Output Resolution from the current or default setting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-reduce-the-output-resolution.jpg"                      alt="obs reduce the output resolution"                ></p><p>Step 4: Click Apply for saving the changes followed by Ok button.</p><h2 id="Way-3-Reduce-The-Video-Bitrate"><a href="#Way-3-Reduce-The-Video-Bitrate" class="headerlink" title="Way 3. Reduce The Video Bitrate"></a>Way 3. Reduce The Video Bitrate</h2><p>OBS generally does not maintain a specified bitrate. It keeps on changing the bitrate as per the available condition like CPU usage level and bandwidth and speed of internet connection. When there are constant changes in the bitrate, there is a likelihood of stuttering effect. Even though it has come up with Dynamic bitrate which will automatically reduce the bitrate, but it increases the bitrate when there is no congestion. You can reduce the bitrate by going through these steps.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS Studio and click on Settings button.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Output tab and look for Video Bitrate option.</p><p>Step 3: Lower the video bitrate from the default or current value.</p><p>Step 4: Click on Apply and OK button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-reduce-the-video-birate.jpg"                      alt="obs reduce the video birate"                ></p><h2 id="Way-4-Change-OBS-Process-Priority"><a href="#Way-4-Change-OBS-Process-Priority" class="headerlink" title="Way 4. Change OBS Process Priority"></a>Way 4. Change OBS Process Priority</h2><p>By changing the OBS process priority from Normal to Above Normal, there could be more processing power availability for OBS Studio. It helps in solving the problem of frame drop by driving performance from the system for better encoding and rendering. Here are the steps for changing OBS process priority.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS and go to Settings.</p><p>Step 3: Go to Advanced tab and look for Process Priority.</p><p>Step 4: You will have to change it to ‘Above Normal’ from ‘Normal’.</p><p>Step 5: Click Apply followed by Ok button.</p><h2 id="Way-5-Update-Network-Driver"><a href="#Way-5-Update-Network-Driver" class="headerlink" title="Way 5. Update Network Driver"></a>Way 5. Update Network Driver</h2><p>Dropped frame rates can happen due to the outdated network adapter driver. For this, it is important to look for the latest version of the driver. With up-to-date drivers, there will be a smooth connection when you are streaming or playing online games. Here are the steps to follow.</p><p>Step 1: From Start menu, search for Device Manager and open it.</p><p>Step 2: Find Network Adapters and click on it to expand.</p><p>Step 3: Find your LAN card and right-click on it.</p><p>Step 4: From the menu, select Update Driver option.</p><p>Follow the onscreen instruction to complete the process and restart your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/device-manager-update-network-driver-2.jpg"                      alt="device manager update network driver"                ></p><h2 id="Way-6-Turn-Off-Your-Firewall-and-Antivirus"><a href="#Way-6-Turn-Off-Your-Firewall-and-Antivirus" class="headerlink" title="Way 6. Turn Off Your Firewall and Antivirus"></a>Way 6. Turn Off Your Firewall and Antivirus</h2><p>There can be instances where firewalls can block the port for RTMP. It can interfere with the internet connection leading to dropping frames. Similarly, antivirus software messes with any third-party software and prevents regular operations.

The introduction of a hybrid console is truly a success that offers an extraordinary graphical quality while transitioning within the home console. Although this unique adaptability needs the compromise over functionality and power compared with the handhelds and dedicated consoles that have been introduced before. The games are played on the home part that is dock and console itself, over which we put the console in the dock to get the output image over the TV screen.</p><p>Moreover, it doesn’t require the installation of the software over the hard drive. It also includes the Micro SD slot at the switch backside, which provides additional storage capacity. But the main question is <strong>how to record switch gameplay</strong>?</p><p>There are basically three ways for <strong>Nintendo switch video capture</strong> gameplay.</p><p>This article will be in two part:</p><hr><p>Part I: Capture Your Switch Video</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>1. Capture the 30s video with Nintendo Switch Record button</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>2. Record your whole gameplay with game built-in function</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"></a><a href="#part3"><strong>3. Record your whole gameplay with Capture Card</strong></a></li></ul><hr><h3 id="1-Capture-the-30s-video-with-Nintendo-Switch-Record-button"><a href="#1-Capture-the-30s-video-with-Nintendo-Switch-Record-button" class="headerlink" title="1. Capture the 30s video with Nintendo Switch Record button"></a>1. Capture the 30s video with Nintendo Switch Record button</h3><p>The controllers come up with the built-in capture button. However, this button only allows the screenshot of the video which is not ideal in any case. But it records the video for 30 seconds as well. If this time is enough to capture your gameplay then do the steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Hold the controller in your hand.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press the capture button on the left side of controller.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-console-pic.png"                      alt="switch-game-console"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Hold down this capture button marked with the square</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Wait until the message regarding capture completion is received at the screen top</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Your last 30 seconds of gameplay will be saved in the ‘Albums.’ It will record the 30 seconds gameplay right before you press the button down, so there is no need to worry about hitting it in advance. It is a quite simple step and allows only posting the clips to social media or saving them in your phone album. It also provides video editing before posting it on social media. You will be able to see the Nintendo Switch video capture in the Albums.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/switch-interface.png"                      alt="switch-interface"                ></p><h3 id="2-Record-your-whole-gameplay-with-game-built-in-function"><a href="#2-Record-your-whole-gameplay-with-game-built-in-function" class="headerlink" title="2. Record your whole gameplay with game built-in function"></a>2. Record your whole gameplay with game built-in function</h3><p>If you wish to save some important moves of your game in your album, then here is the second way. Some games have the option of replay saving at their bottoms, <a class="link"   href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a%5Fid/27540/~/how-to-capture-and-edit-gameplay-video" >complete list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> including:</p><ul><li><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></li><li><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></li><li><em>ARMS</em></li><li><em>Splatoon 2</em></li></ul><p>Let’s take Smach Bros as an example. To do the recording, follow the steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> As soon as you have finished the game, the screen of the final score appears. A button appears at the top right down corner of the screen ‘Do you want to save the game’. <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smash-bros-interface.png"                      alt="smash-bro-ending"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the ‘Y’ button and then click on ‘Save.’<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smash-bros-saving.png"                      alt="smash-bros-saving"                ></p><p>Tips: Make sure that you don’t press buttons other than ‘Y’ if you want to save the gameplay. The game replay will be lost if you do so.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The video will be saved in the replays where you can check it. Go to the ‘Menu’ and then ‘Replays’, and the saved video will appear here (however, there is one limitation of such replays saved, that is they will be deleted as soon as the game is updated so make sure that you save the game replays in your album).</p><p>To convert the replays in the video, a straightforward option is given in the menu ‘Convert to Video.’ Go to the replay that you would like to save. Look at the right down corner and click on the ‘Convert to Video’ option.<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gameplay-quality1.jpg"                      alt="video-quality-interface"                ></p><p>Tips: Within the video conversion settings, you can include information about the display, music, sound effects, and video quality of the replay. Check all these settings and select them the way you want your gameplay to be. Video quality is the most important thing to consider.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Your gameplay will be converted to the video. In the videos section of the game menu, you will find all the videos that you have saved. Now power off your Switch and remove the SD card from your Switch. Connect the SD card with PC, it will appear in the folders shown below.</p><p> <strong><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gameplay-folder1.jpg"                      alt="saving-folder"                ></strong></p><h3 id="3-Record-your-whole-gameplay-with-Capture-Card"><a href="#3-Record-your-whole-gameplay-with-Capture-Card" class="headerlink" title="3.

By clicking the “copy link” button, individuals can copy and share the link with people they would like to invite to the meeting.</p><p>If they want to directly share the link, they can also click the “Send Invite” button and copy the meeting invite from there as well as share via email.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-google-meet-invite-link-gmail.jpg"                      alt="share google meet invitation link on Gmail"                ></p><p>Upon clicking the “Share Via Email” option, users will be redirected to a new tab where they can see an email pop up and from there, they can invite participants to the session through their email address, as indicated in the image below.</p><p>If individuals want to instantly create and start the session, they can click the “Start Now” option, and the meeting will automatically start.</p><h3 id="2-Creating-Google-Meet-Sessions-Through-Google-Calendar-3"><a href="#2-Creating-Google-Meet-Sessions-Through-Google-Calendar-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Google Calendar"></a>2. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Google Calendar</h3><p>Another way to create a Google Meet session is through the Google Calendar. Much like the process of creating it through Gmail, there are a few steps involved, but the process is very easy.</p><p>First individuals must go to the Google Calendar homepage and click the “Create” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-google-meet-session-google-calendar.jpg"                      alt="create google meet  on google calendar"                ></p><p>After clicking the create option, the screen will show two options; “ Event” and “Task”. Click the event option and a pop-up form will show up on the window which must be filled to create a Google Meet event.</p><p>Fill in the form, if you would like to invite participants to the Google Meet conference, you can also list down their email address in the “Add Guests” section. Once you have done that click the “Add Google Meet Video Conferencing” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-google-meet-video-conferencing-calendar.jpg"                      alt="add google meet  on google calendar"                ></p><p>An event link will appear in the form, along with a button that says “Join With Google Meet”.

To create Google Meet sessions, click the “New Meeting’’ option.</p><p>Upon clicking that button, three new options will appear:</p><ul><li>Get a meeting link to share - use this when you would like to create a meeting link and share it with other invitees and start the meeting after some time</li><li>Start an instant meeting - make use of this option if you would like to automatically join the meeting and then share the link with participants later on</li><li>Schedule in Google Calendar - use this option when you would like to create a meeting for the future.

The best way to schedule and create Google Meet links for the future is through Google Calendar.</p><p>One must first redirect themselves to the Google Calendar homepage and click the create option in the top left corner of their screen.</p><p>They must then select “Event” and proceed from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-calendar-google-meet-event.jpg"                      alt="Create  google meet on Google Calendar"                ></p><p>A pop-up form will appear on the screen which requires information regarding the conference.

Then move on to the date and time section and set the date to a time in the future for when you require the session to take place.</p><p>You can change the date by clicking on the date in the form, then a drop-down menu will appear from which you can choose the required date. Follow the same process for the time as well.</p><p>Once you click save, the meeting will be confirmed and appear on your Google Calendar.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Get-the-Google-Meet-Link-and-Code-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Get-the-Google-Meet-Link-and-Code-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Get the Google Meet Link and Code?"></a>Part 4: How to Get the Google Meet Link and Code?</h2><p>There are numerous ways through which you can get the link to the session.</p><ul><li>Get a link from Google Calendar</li><li>Get a link from Google Meet</li></ul><p>If you are using Google Calendar to get the link, the process is fairly simple. Just go onto the Google Calendar homepage and if you have scheduled the event from before, click on the event you require a Google Meet link for.
