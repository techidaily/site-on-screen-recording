In addition, developers are continually innovating their programs to make your document processing easier. For example, you can now use google translate voice to text when you are typing a document for a diverse audience.</p><p>Below is a full guide on how to translate speech to text the right way with Google Translate. In addition, you will discover alternatives to google speech translate, including their summary and how they compare to one another.</p><h2 id="Part1-How-to-translate-speech-to-text-with-Google-Translate"><a href="#Part1-How-to-translate-speech-to-text-with-Google-Translate" class="headerlink" title="Part1: How to translate speech to text with Google Translate?"></a>Part1: How to translate speech to text with Google Translate?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/google-speech-translate-1.jpg"                      alt="translate speech"                ></p><p>Google Translate is one of the easiest voice typing apps to use. However, before you go through the steps on how to use Google speech translate, here are a few points you need to consider:</p><ul><li>You need to have an external microphone to use google speech translate. Laptop and notebook owners can rely on their in-built microphone, and desktop users will need an external one. In addition, using a headset has better results than an external microphone.</li><li>Ensure you allow google translate voice to text to access your device’s microphone. You will find your microphone settings in the <strong>Control Panel</strong> for Windows and <strong>Preferences</strong> if you are a Mac user.</li><li>Unfortunately, you cannot upload audio files to Google speech translate. In addition, there is no information if subsequent updates of the app will include the feature.</li><li>Regarding Google speech to text pricing, the app is free to download and use. Although the service is available from the web browser, having an active Google account enables you to access its full features.</li><li>Although Google translate voice to text can detect your language, it does suffer accuracy issues occasionally. Therefore, confirm that you select the correct language before using the translation service.</li></ul><p>The above points apply to all versions of Google speech translate, whether on your smartphone, tablet, or computer. Now that you are aware of the app’s key user points, here is how you can translate speech to text with Google Translate:</p><p>1. Launch the app from your device’s home screen or the installation directory for computer users.</p><p>2. Select the languages you want to translate from the main screen using the arrow buttons on the bottom right corner of each box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/google-speech-translate-2.jpg"                      alt="arrow buttons"                ></p><p>For example, if you want to translate English to French, English will appear in the first box and French in the other. Kindly note that the app does not detect microphone input automatically. The feature is only available for typed text.</p><p>3. Proceed to the bottom of the page and click the Microphone button to begin translating your speech to text input. Ensure you are in a quiet environment for best results.</p><p>4. You can end your recording by clicking the Stop button.</p><p>5. You can listen to your translation by clicking the Listen button from the right box of Google speech translate.

The service only supports translation of the following file types;</p><ul><li>Docx</li><li>Pdf</li><li>Pptx</li><li>Xlsx</li></ul><p>It also allows you to translate websites in your browser automatically. Here is how to translate websites with Google Translate:</p><ol><li>Click on the Websites tab from the app’s home page.</li><li>Select the original language as Detect Language because the app refers to its over 100-language library to determine the source language. Inputting the wrong source language will result in an incorrect translation.</li><li>Type the URL you need to translate in the Website textbox and click Go to view the website in your preferred language.</li></ol><p>So, how can you translate recorded audio using Google Translate? Follow the below steps:</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137379/7443" target="_top" id="2137379">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137379" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137379/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Use-other-transcribe-tools-to-transcript-the-audio"><a href="#Use-other-transcribe-tools-to-transcript-the-audio" class="headerlink" title="Use other transcribe tools to transcript the audio"></a>Use other transcribe tools to transcript the audio</h3><p>As earlier mentioned, you can only use Google Translate with text documents and websites. As such, you need to transcribe the recorded speech using a different transcription app, then upload the transcript to Google Translate. The compatible file formats are .docx, .pdf, .pptx, and .xlsx.</p><p>Some of the transcribing apps you can use include, Trint, Rev, and Happy Scribe. In addition, check if the apps require you to purchase a subscription before using them. Although some apps offer free trials, your access may have feature limitations. For example, most apps limit transcription of recorded audio files to between five and sixty minutes, depending on the developer.</p><h3 id="Paste-to-Google-translate"><a href="#Paste-to-Google-translate" class="headerlink" title="Paste to Google translate"></a>Paste to Google translate</h3><p>Once you finish transcribing the speech recording from the third-party app, ensure you save it in the file formats indicated above. You will then follow the below steps to finish translating your speech recording.</p><ol><li>Launch Google Translate on your device.</li><li>Tap the Documents tab from the app’s home screen.</li><li>Select the Detect Language option for the left box, and choose your desired translation language for the right box. Typically, the app lists English, Spanish, and Arabic as the default language options. However, you will find additional languages by clicking the down arrow on the right. Google Translate has over 100 languages in its internal library, including Xhosa and Latin. Despite this, you should always check the translation accuracy before submitting your work. This is because the app can sometimes ignore the translation language’s grammar and punctuation rules.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1516072">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1516072.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1516072">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1516072.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1516072%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1516072/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What’s-the-Best-Alternative-to-Google-STT-Translation"><a href="#What’s-the-Best-Alternative-to-Google-STT-Translation" class="headerlink" title="What’s the Best Alternative to Google STT Translation?"></a>What’s the Best Alternative to Google STT Translation?</h3><p>Google translate voice to text is among the top voice typing apps in the market.

This is unmatched by any free video recording software. You can also record gameplay at 4K HDR with 60FPS. It comes with hardware acceleration to ensure the performance does not get affected while recording in the background.</p><p><strong>Instant Replay</strong> - ShadowPlay keeps recording in the background and therefore, if something important has happened in the game, you can get the last 30 seconds of instant replay clip and you can share it anywhere you want. This is highly useful to share short clips on social media platforms.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay Highlights</strong> - The feature will automatically record the best gaming moments and create a perfect highlight video. This is useful when you want to upload the best parts of the gameplay rather than the entire part.</p><p><strong>Screenshots</strong> - ShadowPlay lets you capture 8K screenshots of your game that you can use as thumbnails for your videos as well as put them up on social media platforms.</p><p><strong>GIF Creator</strong> - With ShadowPlay, you don’t have to leave the game to create GIFs. You can create high-quality GIFs of duration 15 seconds. You can also add text to the GIFs and share anything you want.</p><p>Just like OBS, ShadowPlay enables you to broadcast gameplay in real-time on YouTube Live, Twitch, and Facebook Live.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Comparison-ShadowPlay-vs-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-Comparison-ShadowPlay-vs-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Comparison ShadowPlay vs OBS"></a>Part 2. Comparison ShadowPlay vs OBS</h2><p>Here are the key points of differences between OBS and ShadowPlay that will help you decide between OBS or ShadowPlay.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS</strong> <strong>Recording:</strong></p><p>While recording, OBS allows faster processing of the recorded video files. Besides, it can compress the file size during the encoding process so that the recorded video files take relatively less space. This makes it ideal for longer sessions of gameplay recording. However, in the process, OBS can reduce the frame rate significantly, and hence, the video may not be as smooth as you expect it to be. Therefore, OBS is suitable for regular game recording where not much compression is required.</p><p>On the contrary, ShadowPlay does not reduce the file size or frame rate, and hence, it is a great choice for high-end games where you need the recorded to be as smooth as possible. However, ShadowPlay requires more space on the hard drive. When you upload on video streaming platforms, there will be some automatic compression. Therefore, the less compression you do during your encoding phase, the better will be the output.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Performance:</strong></p><p>OBS uses significant CPU power and resources. This is one of the reasons why it reduces the frame rate while recording to use less CPU resources. In fact, it can affect the game performance if you are playing and recording a high-end game. However, you can customize various configuration parameters to reduce its burden on CPU performance.</p><p>ShadowPlay does not affect the CPU performance as it comes with hardware acceleration. It supports higher frame rates for high-end games as well. If at all, it can bring about 5%-10% effect on CPU performance which is almost ignorable in comparison to OBS.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS File Format</strong>:</p><p>OBS consumes less space for recorded videos. It compresses the format which can drastically reduce the output file size. The best thing about OBS is that it comes with the NVENC hardware encoded chip that allows choosing from different supported file formats.</p><p>On the contrary, ShadowPlay supports MP4 formats by default which makes it require more space. It uses  codec. MP4 file format is the most popular video file format that you can play across all media players and upload on online platforms.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Live Streaming</strong>:</p><p>You cannot live stream as well as record on ShadowPlay. This is a major drawback that OBS has overcome. That is why most gamers prefer OBS Studio for live streaming as they can record the gaming session for future reference. If you want to just broadcast your gameplay, ShadowPlay is good enough. But if you want to have multiple scenes and overlay adjustments in live streaming, OBS is the best choice.</p><p><strong>ShadowPlay vs OBS Editing:</strong></p><p>OBS offers better editing options thanks to its built-in editor. Starting customizable transitions to real-time editing before broadcasting, OBS has different editing scopes tailor-made for gamers. On the contrary, ShadowPlay has very limited editing options as the main focus is on recording only. But if we talk about true video editing, both applications are still underdeveloped on this front.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Alternative-Way-To-Record-Games"><a href="#Part-3-Alternative-Way-To-Record-Games" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

We’ve compiled 10 games like GTA V to keep you occupied until we find out what’s next for the series.</p><h3 id="1-Red-Dead-Redemption-2"><a href="#1-Red-Dead-Redemption-2" class="headerlink" title="1.Red Dead Redemption 2"></a>1.Red Dead Redemption 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/red-dead-redemption-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="red-dead-redemption-2-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p>The same studio makes both the GTA series and Red Dead, so you can probably guess why that one’s here. As with its predecessor, Red Dead Redemption 2 has an open world that feels alive, and it never says away from including interesting details. Following an outlaw gang who hopes to pull one last heist before retiring, it is primarily a story of trust and betrayal. The story is not as simple as it seems, and many unexpected twists and turns are revealed. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a great game if you like GTA 5 with a Wild West theme and revolver weapons. Its setting is reminiscent of GTA’s belief in player freedom. If you’re in the mood for a Grand Theft Auto experience, Red Dead Redemption 2 is well worth your time.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Visuals and voice acting is incredible.</p><p>• Side quests and main missions that will thrill you.</p><p>• Many side distractions that are both ludicrous and delightful.</p><p>• You feel like you have gone back a century.</p><h3 id="2-Assassin’s-Creed-Origins"><a href="#2-Assassin’s-Creed-Origins" class="headerlink" title="2.Assassin’s Creed Origins"></a>2.Assassin’s Creed Origins</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/assassins-creed-origins-poster.jpg"                      alt="assassins-creed-origins-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows, Google Stadia</p><p>The Assassin’s Creed series has increasingly emphasized open-world gameplay, making it a great choice for GTA 5 fans.

In this regard, Rockstar’s new game straddles a much closer line between contemporary Grand Theft Auto games and its own setting for a biting satire. From Grand Theft Auto 5, do you remember the mission “Life Invaders”? It’s pretty cool to use bungee-corded pool balls as weapons. This is essentially what Watch Dogs 2 is like, but blown up into an entire game.

The design philosophy of Yakuza 0 is taken to its logical conclusion. Yakuza 0 joins the likes of Grand Theft Auto 5 with karaoke, pool, arcade games, wrestling, bowling, dancing, gambling, and… I think awkwardly viewing some explicit material in the back of a video store. Those last two can attest that not all side activities are tastefully done, but the sheer number and variety of options are astonishing. Compared to GTA, Yakuza has a much smaller scope, but what it lacks in quantity (quirky, offbeat) it makes up for in quality.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• It’s so diverse.</p><p>• Funny writing that is snappy and genuinely funny.</p><p>• There are some great sidequests.</p><p>• The storyline and main characters are good.</p><h3 id="7-Sleeping-Dogs"><a href="#7-Sleeping-Dogs" class="headerlink" title="7.Sleeping Dogs"></a>7.Sleeping Dogs</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sleeping-dogs-poster.jpg"                      alt="sleeping-dogs-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One, PS3, Xbox 360</p><p>In keeping with its name, Sleeping Dogs was a sleeper hit in 2012. Combining the action of B-movie stunt movies with the conventions of the open-world crime genre, it becomes a sleeper hit. With its garb of a classic Bruce Lee film, it feels like Grand Theft Auto dressed up as a classic video game. Unfortunately, Sleeping Dogs 2 was canned while still in its early stages of development, making it a rare gem that deserves to be appreciated for what it brought to the table. Sleeping Dogs was re-released in 2014 on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, so there’s really no excuse to let it remain unpurchased (sorry).</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Fights well drives well and runs well.</p><p>• A well-acted and told story.</p><p>• The game features fierce melee combat, an alluring atmosphere, and fun gunplay.</p><p>• You can find a variety of collectibles and enjoy many other diversions.</p><h3 id="8-The-Saboteur"><a href="#8-The-Saboteur" class="headerlink" title="8.The Saboteur"></a>8.The Saboteur</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-saboteur-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-saboteur-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Microsoft Windows, iOS, Xbox 360, BlackBerry, PlayStation 3</p><p>Taking the open-world game experience and tying it to a WWII setting makes The Saboteur a great game. With multiple realistic historical elements, it is set during the German occupation in France. Sean Devlin, an Irish cab driver who joins the resistance after the German soldiers kill his best friend, is the protagonist of The Saboteur.</p><p>Gameplay-wise, The Saboteur and GTA 5 have a lot in common. Both involve running around an open world, stealing cars, causing havoc, and evading the law. Gamers will be entertained for hours with The Saboteur’s interesting open-world gameplay and side-quests.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Action that moves quickly.</p><p>• Filter for black and white graphics.</p><p>• There is a vast world to discover in this game.</p><p>• Excellent sound design and a great story.</p><h3 id="9-Mafia-Definitive-Edition"><a href="#9-Mafia-Definitive-Edition" class="headerlink" title="9.Mafia: Definitive Edition"></a>9.Mafia: Definitive Edition</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mafia-definite-edition-poster.jpg"                      alt="mafia-definite-edition-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows</p><p>While Mafia: Definitive Edition lacks the open-world concept as much as fans would have liked, its mafia-themed story makes up for it. Mafia’s story is similar to GTA 5’s astonishing storytelling ability. Tommy Angelo is a cab driver who becomes involved in the Mafia after an unfortunate event. Fans are kept on edge by Mafia’s story as they experience unexpected betrayal and heartbreaking forgiveness.</p><p>Additionally, Mafia provides a third-person perspective and multiple weapons within the game, similar to GTA 5.

We tried our best to keep those titles in this list that are closely related to GTA 5 and offers similar gameplay experience. Although the dynamics of these games will be different compared to GTA 5, you will enjoy the gameplay.</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p>The same studio makes both the GTA series and Red Dead, so you can probably guess why that one’s here. As with its predecessor, Red Dead Redemption 2 has an open world that feels alive, and it never says away from including interesting details. Following an outlaw gang who hopes to pull one last heist before retiring, it is primarily a story of trust and betrayal. The story is not as simple as it seems, and many unexpected twists and turns are revealed. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a great game if you like GTA 5 with a Wild West theme and revolver weapons. Its setting is reminiscent of GTA’s belief in player freedom. If you’re in the mood for a Grand Theft Auto experience, Red Dead Redemption 2 is well worth your time.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Visuals and voice acting is incredible.</p><p>• Side quests and main missions that will thrill you.</p><p>• Many side distractions that are both ludicrous and delightful.</p><p>• You feel like you have gone back a century.</p><h3 id="2-Assassin’s-Creed-Origins-2"><a href="#2-Assassin’s-Creed-Origins-2" class="headerlink" title="2.Assassin’s Creed Origins"></a>2.Assassin’s Creed Origins</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/assassins-creed-origins-poster.jpg"                      alt="assassins-creed-origins-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows, Google Stadia</p><p>The Assassin’s Creed series has increasingly emphasized open-world gameplay, making it a great choice for GTA 5 fans. You’ll find plenty of fun to be had with its vast world that is three times larger than Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag. There are dungeons and pyramids to explore so that you won’t get bored.</p><p>As well as this, it has a great story that offers a refreshing change of pace from the assassin-focused theme of the original series. In some historical accuracy, Aya and Bayek, who collaborate with Cleopatra to become the first assassins, are depicted by Assassin’s Creed Origins.

In this regard, Rockstar’s new game straddles a much closer line between contemporary Grand Theft Auto games and its own setting for a biting satire. From Grand Theft Auto 5, do you remember the mission “Life Invaders”? It’s pretty cool to use bungee-corded pool balls as weapons. This is essentially what Watch Dogs 2 is like, but blown up into an entire game. Despite Watch Dogs 2’s parody of Silicon Valley, Rockstar’s still packs a punch that Ubisoft’s doesn’t, but anyone who has ever had to watch an Apple conference or a Facebook ad will laugh no end.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• An entertaining and strong mission design.</p><p>• There is a lot to see and do in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>• Hack into any electronic device.</p><p>• The concept is very similar to GTA V but it is more of a tech genre game.</p><h3 id="4-Saints-Row-The-Third-2"><a href="#4-Saints-Row-The-Third-2" class="headerlink" title="4.Saints Row: The Third"></a>4.Saints Row: The Third</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/saintsrow-the-third-poster.png"                      alt="saintsrow-the-third-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, Xbox One, Switch, PS3, Xbox 360</p><p>Initially, Saints Row was an obvious ripoff of GTA, desperately trying to copy Rockstar’s style. In the end, it was a mediocre effort that garnered a cult following for two games but failed to make a lasting impression. Saints Row: The Third, in contrast, took note of how grim and serious games like GTA were becoming, said “f that,” and made them ridiculous.</p><p>You play as a group of friends so widely known and loved that you rob a bank dressed as novelty costumes of yourselves. Players will face a small-scale zombie apocalypse, make various decisions that matter, and fight with a three-foot-long dildo bat as a melee weapon. Many GTA-like games get stuck in their own self-importance, but Saints Row just stays as silly as possible. Although this is an older game, it has backward compatibility on Xbox One and was ported to Nintendo Switch in 2019, so it is a great excuse to revisit the Saints once again.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Activities that are absurd and surreal.</p><p>• Plot twists that will make your head spin.</p><p>• The world has a tremendous amount of depth.</p><p>• Driving and combat models that are simple.</p><h3 id="5-Just-Cause-4-2"><a href="#5-Just-Cause-4-2" class="headerlink" title="5.Just Cause 4"></a>5.Just Cause 4</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/just-cause4-poster.jpg"                      alt="just-cause4-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p>You, the player, have a lot of freedom in Just Cause 4, so you can achieve unprecedented levels of chaos.

Despite Watch Dogs 2’s parody of Silicon Valley, Rockstar’s still packs a punch that Ubisoft’s doesn’t, but anyone who has ever had to watch an Apple conference or a Facebook ad will laugh no end.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• An entertaining and strong mission design.</p><p>• There is a lot to see and do in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>• Hack into any electronic device.</p><p>• The concept is very similar to GTA V but it is more of a tech genre game.</p><h3 id="4-Saints-Row-The-Third-3"><a href="#4-Saints-Row-The-Third-3" class="headerlink" title="4.Saints Row: The Third"></a>4.Saints Row: The Third</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/saintsrow-the-third-poster.png"                      alt="saintsrow-the-third-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, Xbox One, Switch, PS3, Xbox 360</p><p>Initially, Saints Row was an obvious ripoff of GTA, desperately trying to copy Rockstar’s style. In the end, it was a mediocre effort that garnered a cult following for two games but failed to make a lasting impression. Saints Row: The Third, in contrast, took note of how grim and serious games like GTA were becoming, said “f that,” and made them ridiculous.</p><p>You play as a group of friends so widely known and loved that you rob a bank dressed as novelty costumes of yourselves. Players will face a small-scale zombie apocalypse, make various decisions that matter, and fight with a three-foot-long dildo bat as a melee weapon. Many GTA-like games get stuck in their own self-importance, but Saints Row just stays as silly as possible. Although this is an older game, it has backward compatibility on Xbox One and was ported to Nintendo Switch in 2019, so it is a great excuse to revisit the Saints once again.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Activities that are absurd and surreal.</p><p>• Plot twists that will make your head spin.</p><p>• The world has a tremendous amount of depth.</p><p>• Driving and combat models that are simple.</p><h3 id="5-Just-Cause-4-3"><a href="#5-Just-Cause-4-3" class="headerlink" title="5.Just Cause 4"></a>5.Just Cause 4</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/just-cause4-poster.jpg"                      alt="just-cause4-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One</p><p>You, the player, have a lot of freedom in Just Cause 4, so you can achieve unprecedented levels of chaos. Don’t forget your wingsuit. Your grappling hook is ready. Cars that can be surfed as a massive tornado lifts them into the air. Just wait until you see what you can achieve in The Republic of Medici if the ragdoll physics amused you in GTA 5. In truth, Rockstar’s latest offering lacks the storytelling prowess of its signature franchise but instead excels at choreographing carnage on an epic scale.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• The abilities of Rico are immensely powerful.</p><p>• The setting is beautiful and varied.</p><p>• Extreme weather conditions are the essence of Just Cause.</p><p>• New gadgets can be experimented with on the physics system.</p><h3 id="6-Yakuza-0-3"><a href="#6-Yakuza-0-3" class="headerlink" title="6.Yakuza 0"></a>6.Yakuza 0</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/yakuza0-poster.jpg"                      alt="yakuza0-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087394/7443" target="_top" id="2087394">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087394" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087394/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4</p><p>With so many side activities to enjoy outside of the main campaign, Grand Theft Auto has always been praised for the way it brings cities to life. The design philosophy of Yakuza 0 is taken to its logical conclusion. Yakuza 0 joins the likes of Grand Theft Auto 5 with karaoke, pool, arcade games, wrestling, bowling, dancing, gambling, and… I think awkwardly viewing some explicit material in the back of a video store. Those last two can attest that not all side activities are tastefully done, but the sheer number and variety of options are astonishing. Compared to GTA, Yakuza has a much smaller scope, but what it lacks in quantity (quirky, offbeat) it makes up for in quality.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• It’s so diverse.</p><p>• Funny writing that is snappy and genuinely funny.</p><p>• There are some great sidequests.</p><p>• The storyline and main characters are good.</p><h3 id="7-Sleeping-Dogs-3"><a href="#7-Sleeping-Dogs-3" class="headerlink" title="7.Sleeping Dogs"></a>7.Sleeping Dogs</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sleeping-dogs-poster.jpg"                      alt="sleeping-dogs-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One, PS3, Xbox 360</p><p>In keeping with its name, Sleeping Dogs was a sleeper hit in 2012. Combining the action of B-movie stunt movies with the conventions of the open-world crime genre, it becomes a sleeper hit. With its garb of a classic Bruce Lee film, it feels like Grand Theft Auto dressed up as a classic video game. Unfortunately, Sleeping Dogs 2 was canned while still in its early stages of development, making it a rare gem that deserves to be appreciated for what it brought to the table. Sleeping Dogs was re-released in 2014 on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, so there’s really no excuse to let it remain unpurchased (sorry).</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Fights well drives well and runs well.</p><p>• A well-acted and told story.</p><p>• The game features fierce melee combat, an alluring atmosphere, and fun gunplay.</p><p>• You can find a variety of collectibles and enjoy many other diversions.</p><h3 id="8-The-Saboteur-3"><a href="#8-The-Saboteur-3" class="headerlink" title="8.The Saboteur"></a>8.The Saboteur</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/the-saboteur-poster.jpg"                      alt="the-saboteur-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Microsoft Windows, iOS, Xbox 360, BlackBerry, PlayStation 3</p><p>Taking the open-world game experience and tying it to a WWII setting makes The Saboteur a great game. With multiple realistic historical elements, it is set during the German occupation in France. Sean Devlin, an Irish cab driver who joins the resistance after the German soldiers kill his best friend, is the protagonist of The Saboteur.</p><p>Gameplay-wise, The Saboteur and GTA 5 have a lot in common. Both involve running around an open world, stealing cars, causing havoc, and evading the law. Gamers will be entertained for hours with The Saboteur’s interesting open-world gameplay and side-quests.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Action that moves quickly.</p><p>• Filter for black and white graphics.</p><p>• There is a vast world to discover in this game.</p><p>• Excellent sound design and a great story.</p><h3 id="9-Mafia-Definitive-Edition-3"><a href="#9-Mafia-Definitive-Edition-3" class="headerlink" title="9.Mafia: Definitive Edition"></a>9.Mafia: Definitive Edition</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mafia-definite-edition-poster.jpg"                      alt="mafia-definite-edition-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006941/19272" target="_top" id="2006941">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006941" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006941/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Windows</p><p>While Mafia: Definitive Edition lacks the open-world concept as much as fans would have liked, its mafia-themed story makes up for it. Mafia’s story is similar to GTA 5’s astonishing storytelling ability. Tommy Angelo is a cab driver who becomes involved in the Mafia after an unfortunate event. Fans are kept on edge by Mafia’s story as they experience unexpected betrayal and heartbreaking forgiveness.</p><p>Additionally, Mafia provides a third-person perspective and multiple weapons within the game, similar to GTA 5. There are a lot of similarities between the Mafia franchise and GTA 5.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• This is an excellent story.</p><p>• The artwork for Lost Heaven is stunning.</p><p>• The original story is enhanced by new voice work and facial captures.</p><p>• The visuals are impressive.</p><h3 id="10-Grand-Theft-Auto-IV-3"><a href="#10-Grand-Theft-Auto-IV-3" class="headerlink" title="10.Grand Theft Auto IV"></a>10.Grand Theft Auto IV</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gta4-poster.jpg"                      alt="gta4-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Microsoft Windows</p><p>In the franchise’s history, Grand Theft Auto IV was the first game to have online capabilities. While other Grand Theft Auto games adopted an arcade style of driving, this game focused on realistic driving mechanics. There isn’t nearly as much content as in Grand Theft Auto V’s online, but there is plenty to enjoy. The intriguing story mode in Grand Theft Auto IV focuses on protagonist Niko Bellic.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Gameplay footage can now be captured and shared in Video Editor.</p><p>• A great story driven by characters.</p><p>• Modifications and DLC are promised.</p><p>• Independence FM provides custom in-game music.</p><h2 id="Final-Verdict-3"><a href="#Final-Verdict-3" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2><p>So, this was our list of 10 best games like GTA 5.

Using Google, you may quickly find the ISO file for a given game. The “Unknown sources” tab in your phone’s settings should be enabled. Apps from unknown sources may now be installed. This is good news. It is necessary to copy &amp; paste the ISO file into the Emulator’s folder after downloading the game. You’ll need to have a PlayStation 2 BIOS in order to run certain emulators like DamonPS2 Pro, for example. On Google, you may also download this file and put it into the app’s folder. It’s now possible to choose a game to play after having BIOS installed. The PS2 BIOS will then be requested. Return to tapping the game after selecting the BIOS file.

Although the app is free to download and install it does have a number of extra features included for real money. Some of the in app purchases include the ability to use the screen recorder without any type of watermark as well as the full features of the app including the magic button. The magic button is a control feature in which you don’t see any of the recording controls on-screen through the process of recording a video. If you’re careful you can often edit the recording controls out of any video that you produce but ultimately the paid version comes with more features including editing tools as well. If you just wanted to record a quick android video on screen however, AZ produces extremely smooth HD videos on a huge number of devices that run the Lollipop version of android.</p><h4 id="2-ilos-screen-recorder"><a href="#2-ilos-screen-recorder" class="headerlink" title="2. ilos screen recorder"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.icos.ilos.uploader" >ilos screen recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ilos-screen-recorder.png"                      alt="ilos screen recorder"                ></p><p>This screen recorder offers some benefits because it doesn’t require any type of root on your android device. While many screen recording applications do require developer root on your device you can get access to a screen recorder that works on all android 5.0 devices without watermarks, advertising or time limits. Ilos set out to create one of the most functional screen recorders available for android and although this app just handles the recording and not the editing or upload it’s one of the best for video capture on your smartphone because it doesn’t come with any kind of catch.</p><h4 id="3-Shou"><a href="#3-Shou" class="headerlink" title="3.Shou"></a>3.<a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tv.shou.android&hl=en" >Shou <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shou-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="shou screen recorder"                ></p><p>Shou is still a beta application but it features a number of tools that you won’t find in the average screen recording app. As well as having the ability to cast your screen recording to a variety of airplay devices like chrome cast or Miracast you can take a screenshot and activate recording features through gesture control. This eliminates a lot of the hassles that come with seeing recording controls on-screen during captured videos. In order to download the application currently you have to join their Google plus community and follow the direct link to the Google play store. As the app gains more traction and development it may be able to offer more up to its customers as well as be available for full download into Google play marketplace.</p><h4 id="4-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#4-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="4.Screen Recorder"></a>4.<a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.screenrecorder&hl=en" >Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Screen Record is an app that is a little more complicated than simply hitting a record and stop button on your screen recordings.

Unfortunately the functionality of this app does require a rooted device and it isn’t currently available to non-root devices. SCR allows you to record both on screen audio as well as audio through the camera microphone. This means that you can record video on the front facing camera as well as have screen capture available for your device as well. The app is still actively in development and the developers will be consistently updating the screen recorder with brand-new development features. They will consistently beat testing the new app and it has perhaps some of the most interesting features for recording tutorial videos out of any screen capture.

Although the app is free to download and install it does have a number of extra features included for real money. Some of the in app purchases include the ability to use the screen recorder without any type of watermark as well as the full features of the app including the magic button. The magic button is a control feature in which you don’t see any of the recording controls on-screen through the process of recording a video. If you’re careful you can often edit the recording controls out of any video that you produce but ultimately the paid version comes with more features including editing tools as well. If you just wanted to record a quick android video on screen however, AZ produces extremely smooth HD videos on a huge number of devices that run the Lollipop version of android.</p><h4 id="2-ilos-screen-recorder-3"><a href="#2-ilos-screen-recorder-3" class="headerlink" title="2. ilos screen recorder"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.icos.ilos.uploader" >ilos screen recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ilos-screen-recorder.png"                      alt="ilos screen recorder"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135365/19272" target="_top" id="2135365">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135365" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135365/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>This screen recorder offers some benefits because it doesn’t require any type of root on your android device.

This eliminates a lot of the hassles that come with seeing recording controls on-screen during captured videos. In order to download the application currently you have to join their Google plus community and follow the direct link to the Google play store. As the app gains more traction and development it may be able to offer more up to its customers as well as be available for full download into Google play marketplace.</p><h4 id="4-Screen-Recorder-3"><a href="#4-Screen-Recorder-3" class="headerlink" title="4.Screen Recorder"></a>4.<a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.screenrecorder&hl=en" >Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Screen Record is an app that is a little more complicated than simply hitting a record and stop button on your screen recordings. To activate screen record you need to decide the amount of time that you would like videos to record for. This capture device is actually only good for capturing up to 120 seconds free. In the paid version of the app however you can save much larger videos. By setting the filename as well as the length of recording you can save a variety of MP4 videos to your SD card. Although this is an ideal for longer videos or potentially producing tutorials on your android device it is great for recording very quick clips and moving animations.</p><h4 id="5-Download-manager-for-android-3"><a href="#5-Download-manager-for-android-3" class="headerlink" title="5.Download manager for android"></a>5.<a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tt.android.dm.view&hl=en" >Download manager for android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This app is primarily a download manager that you can use in your browser but it comes with featured support for ripping music, video and other files from websites.
