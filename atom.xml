Understand that Stardew Valley is regarded as a simulation role-playing video game. This video game was developed by no one else but Eric Barone. While it was released in February 2016 for Microsoft Windows, it later made its debut in:</p><ul><li>Xbox one</li><li>PlayStation Vita</li><li>iOS</li><li>Android</li><li>MacOS</li><li>Linux, and even;</li><li>PlayStation 4</li></ul><p>Are you wondering what makes this game interesting? Well, players tend to act as a character who takes complete control over their late grandfather’s already dilapidated farm. And, this farm is located in a place known as Stardew Valley. It must be noted that this game is entirely open-ended as it enables players to take on diverse activities. These activities include:</p><ul><li>Ore mining</li><li>Growing of crops</li><li>Raising some livestock</li><li>Selling of produce, and;</li><li>Crafting of goods</li></ul><p>More so, your character will get to socialize with the people in the town, proceed to marry, and even have kids. Note that roughly three other players can play this game together online. In other news, Stardew Valley has been regarded over time as a masterpiece. It is filled with a relaxing vibe, romance, and, of course, adventure.</p><p>For those interested, the game begins with you, a box of parsnip seeds, and some handy tools. Bear in mind that Stardew Valley has a lot to offer its players. And, the addition of Ginger Island has made the game very popular. Understand that with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, players have begun new farms and are trying to grow tropical produce to make a profit.

For those who are just starting with Stardew Valley Ginger Island, things may get quite awkward. However, those who already play the Stardew Valley game will be capable of venturing into the quests and solving them. To proceed to Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you will need to restore the community center. Note that this particular task will get players closer to being capable of visiting Ginger Island. However, to restore the community center, you will need to create bundles for no one else but the Junimos. The Junimos are found living inside the community center. By creating all the bundles for the Junimos, they will assist you in restoring the community center. When you are done repairing the community center, you will need to be capable of helping Willy fix his already old boat.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-location.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-location"                ></p><p>Immediately you meet the requirements of restoring the community center and fixing willy’s boat.

When he befriends you, he can begin considering making a move into town. The move to town will make Leo more accessible. In all, Leo is simply a child that will manage to successfully befriend Jas and Vincent whenever he is fully settled in the new home in the Stardew Valley Ginger Island game.</p><h2 id="Features-in-Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island"><a href="#Features-in-Stardew-Valley-Ginger-Island" class="headerlink" title="Features in Stardew Valley Ginger Island"></a><strong>Features in Stardew Valley Ginger Island</strong></h2><p>Some of the intriguing addition players will love in Stardew Valley Ginger Island include:</p><h3 id="1-Volcano-dungeon"><a href="#1-Volcano-dungeon" class="headerlink" title="1.Volcano dungeon"></a>1.Volcano dungeon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stardew-valley-ginger-island-volcano-dungeon.jpg"                      alt="stardew-valley-ginger-island-volcano-dungeon"                ></p><p>This is regarded as an enormous draw for adventurous players.

Apart from playing offline videos, VLC Media Player lets you stream videos from online sources as well as convert videos into different file formats. Besides, there are graphics equalizer and audio normalization available. But one feature that clearly stands out is <strong>VLC rotate video</strong> and save the video file.</p><p>You can rotate a video in VLC clockwise at 90, 180, and 270 degrees. The player also allows you to rotate videos at any arbitrary angle as per your requirement. In fact, you can flip the video horizontally and vertically as well as transpose the video as per your preference. Transposing a video means you are flipping and rotating at the same time.

It could be that the video has been taken at the wrong angle or you want to watch the video at a certain angle from a different perspective. The most common reason is that the video is taken in portrait mode and it looks small on your computer screen with black screen on both sides and you want to rotate the video to landscape mode. Here are the steps to perform VLC rotate video.</p><p>Step 1: Open VLC Media Player.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Media &gt; Open File option and select the video file that you want to rotate.</p><p>Step 3: Once the video opens, go to Tools &gt; Effects and Filters option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-tools-option.jpg"                      alt="vlc tools option"                ></p><p>Step 4: From Adjustments and Effects window, go to Video Effects tab.</p><p>Step 5: Under Video Effects tab, go to Geometry tab.</p><p>Step 6: Check Transform option and from the drop-down menu, select the required options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-adjustments-effects.jpg"                      alt="vlc adjustments and effects"                ></p><p>The options available are – rotate by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, flip horizontally or vertically, transport and anti-transpose.</p><p>Step 7: If you want to rotate the video at any desired angle, you can check Rotate option and select the desired angle from the dial.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-video-effects.jpg"                      alt="vlc video effects"                ></p><p>Step 8: Finally, click on Save button and then on Close button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-rotated-video-vlc.jpg"                      alt="save rotated video vlc"                ></p><p>Now, you will get to see the video as per your selected angle instantly. But note that this VLC rotate effect will stay with VLC and if you open any other video file, it will also be displayed as per your selected angle. In order to disable this rotation effect, follow the same steps and this time, uncheck Transform and Rotate options.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Rotate-Video-in-VLC-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Rotate-Video-in-VLC-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How to Make the Rotation Permanent</h2><p>The previous methods of VLC player rotate video on Windows and Mac will not save the video in that rotated angle as displayed.

For the most comprehensive plan, <strong>Cisco</strong> covers every aspect of the business through interchangeable features. For more extensive group chats, try <strong>Zoom</strong>, but do keep in mind the 40 minute limit on your call times. If your team speak different languages, then use <strong>Skype</strong> – who have a <a class="link"   href="https://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/2016/1212/Skype-s-real-time-language-translator-Can-it-really-connect-the-world" >real-time language-translation tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that shaves hours off your day. Lastly, <strong>UberConference</strong> is arguably the best free video conferencing software for companies who work with lots of different contractors or freelancers on a day-to-day basis. This is because you don’t need to download anything and can just jump straight in.</p><h3 id="2-Q-Is-Zoom-the-same-as-Skype"><a href="#2-Q-Is-Zoom-the-same-as-Skype" class="headerlink" title="2. Q) Is Zoom the same as Skype?"></a>2. Q) Is Zoom the same as Skype?</h3><p>A) Not quite, Skype has more of an International calling focus, while Zoom is more business meeting and conference intuitive. Zoom takes webinars and video teaching and learning as more of a priority than Skype does. Skype, on the other hand, allows free international calling by assigning local caller ID to your number.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136622/26400" target="_top" id="2136622">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136622" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136622/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Q-What-is-the-best-Video-Conferencing-Software-for-Small-Businesses"><a href="#3-Q-What-is-the-best-Video-Conferencing-Software-for-Small-Businesses" class="headerlink" title="3.

In the past, <strong>recording internal audio</strong> in Android is severely restricted by Google.

Still, it picks up background noise while screen capturing is in progress.</p><p>So, how to create an internal audio recording on your Android devices?

Use Mobizen Screen Recorder with Internal Audio App to Record the internal audio on Android</h3><p>Recently, RSUPPORT company developed the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rsupport.mvagent" >Mobizen Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app that is equipped with all the essential screen recording tools. At the same time, it also allows its users to record only sound produced by their Smartphones during the screen recording session. You can download this app for free on the Google Play store, but if you choose to install it on your Android phone, you should arm yourself with patience since this app contains ads.</p><p>After you’ve successfully installed Mobizen Screen Recorder on your Android Smartphone, you should launch the app and look for the Settings gear icon located in the upper right corner of your screen. Tap on the Sound option, and before proceeding any further, you should make sure that Sound is enabled. Once you allow the Sound feature, you’ll be able to see the Options menu that offers External and Internal features. By selecting the Internal option, you will instruct the app to record only the sound produced by the gameplay of the video game you are recording or a YouTube video you’re playing while the screen recording session is in progress.</p><p>The result you will get is the crystal clear audio in your screen recording, but Mobizen app performs well <strong>only with Samsung and LG Android phones</strong>, so if you have an Android device from some other manufacturer, this app may underperform.</p><h3 id="2-Record-the-internal-audio-from-a-microphone-on-Android-with-the-AZ-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#2-Record-the-internal-audio-from-a-microphone-on-Android-with-the-AZ-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="2. Record the internal audio from a microphone on Android with the AZ Screen Recorder"></a>2. Record the internal audio from a microphone on Android with the AZ Screen Recorder</h3><p>If you choose to utilize this method of recording internal audio, make sure that the room where your recording is completely silent since the microphone you will be using can pick up external sounds as well as internal audio.</p><p>You can download the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en" >AZ Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from the Google Play for free. Once the installation is complete, launch the app and tap on the Settings icon. This app won’t record sound until you enable this option, which is the reason why you should locate the Record Audio feature in the Settings menu.</p><p>At this point, you should exit the app, and click on the AZ bubble on the side of your Smartphone’s screen. Tap on the Record icon to start the screen recording session and proceed to perform all actions you wanted to capture with your Android device. The audio will be recorded simultaneously with the video. When ready, slide down the notification bar, and stop the screen recording session.</p><p>In order to extract the audio file, you’ll have to transfer the screen recording you made with AZ Screen Recorder to a PC and perform this action with a video editing software. You may have to create several screen recordings of your Smartphone’s screen before you get the perfect audio because the device’s microphone is going to capture all sound it can pick up, both external and internal.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993650">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993650">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993650%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993650/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Record-Android-internal-audio-with-a-capture-card"><a href="#Part-2-Record-Android-internal-audio-with-a-capture-card" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Record Android internal audio with a capture card"></a>Part 2: Record Android internal audio with a capture card</h2><p>Capture cards are much more than screen recorders since they mostly serve as a bridge between a PC and the device whose screen you are trying to capture. Professionals often use capture cards, despite their prices, simply because they enable them to record high-quality screen recordings, create live streams, and record internal audio from any device they are connected to, including Android Smartphones.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-capture-card.jpg"                      alt="Record Android games on PC with capture card"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134221/18498" target="_top" id="2134221">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134221" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134221/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Most capture cards are equipped with their own screen recording software, so the process of adjusting the video and audio settings depends on the capture card you have. If you have an <a class="link"   href="https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/downloads" >Elgato <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Capture Card you can have complete control over the audio recording process by using the Elgato Sound Capture feature. This powerful tool will enable you to mix sounds from multiple sources, select which microphones will be used during a live stream and adjust the music and sound volumes. However, if you want to use the Elgato, you need to make sure that your PC is compatible with this capture card, and you’ll have to connect your Android Smartphone with this device.</p><p>Using capture cards to record a screen on your Smartphone may be too expensive since capture cards are frequently used as a part of the professional gaming equipment used for streaming or capturing gameplay from games on Xbox or PS4.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Record-Android-Internal-Audio-with-Bandicam-and-the-Nox-Emulator"><a href="#Part-3-Record-Android-Internal-Audio-with-Bandicam-and-the-Nox-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Record Android Internal Audio with Bandicam and the Nox Emulator"></a>Part 3: Record Android Internal Audio with Bandicam and the Nox Emulator</h2><p>Although this may not be the simplest way to record internal audio on your Smartphone device, it is probably the best solution if you want to create high-resolution screen recordings of your Smartphone’s screen and professional internal audio recordings at the same time.</p><p>Before you can start a recording session you must first install <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Bandicam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your PC. This software can be used for the production of high-quality screen recordings of your desktop, and it also offers excellent audio recording options.</p><p>Furthermore, you are going to need an Android emulator, an app that sends the pictures from your Android’s screen to a bigger screen, connected to your Android device.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="When-Order-Falls-Premium-Lineup-of-Best-Zombie-Games"><a href="#When-Order-Falls-Premium-Lineup-of-Best-Zombie-Games" class="headerlink" title="When Order Falls: Premium Lineup of Best Zombie Games"></a>When Order Falls: Premium Lineup of Best Zombie Games</h2><p>Which zombie games are the best for PC? It’s difficult to walk down the street on PC without zombie games grabbing at your leg, so it’s a legitimate concern. Don’t write off the genre because there are a few brainless clones - we’ve compiled a list of some of the zombie games to hit PC.</p><p>There are a lot of zombie enemies in the zombie games, and they enjoy eating brains, and there’s a lot more to them than that. You’ll be forced to put your survival and fighting abilities to the test in a hostile environment, and you’ll discover how humankind can come together in the face of hardship. The zombie games provide a wide range of action-packed adventures that are both complex and entertaining.</p><p>Here are the greatest zombie videogames you can play right now, starting with number 10 and working your way up to our top one pick. Our list of zombie games contains tales with repercussions, resource management, traditional Capcom danger, and more. You’ll be able to discover your new zombie-filled adventure here since it covers a wide range of genres.</p><h3 id="1-Worldwar-Z"><a href="#1-Worldwar-Z" class="headerlink" title="1.Worldwar Z"></a>1.Worldwar Z</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/worldwar-z-poster.jpg"                      alt="worldwar-z-poster"                ></p><p>There isn’t much to World War Z by itself, but there isn’t a better game for mow down dozens, if not hundreds, of zombies with a group of friends or strangers. It’s based in part on the Brad Pitt film from 2013. Nonetheless, it’s mainly an excuse to repeat the film’s one distinguishing attribute: swarms of monsters that rush down streets and crash around curves like a torrent through a breached dam.</p><p>It is undeniably influenced by the Left 4 Dead series (RIP). It does, however, have several modern game mainstays like selectable classes &amp; permanent progression. You may choose to play as a Horror flick, who gets extra health by rapidly killing enemies, a Fixer, who places traps in safe areas, or even one of four additional classes. Whatever character you select to level up first, you’ll get to fire a lot of lead into sliding walls of decaying flesh.</p><h3 id="2-Dying-Light-The-Following"><a href="#2-Dying-Light-The-Following" class="headerlink" title="2.Dying Light: The Following"></a>2.Dying Light: The Following</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dying-light-the-following-poster.jpg"                      alt="dying-light-the-following-poster"                ></p><p>Running over zombies has never been more fun. The Foregoing is really a DLC for Dying Light that eliminates much of the parkour again from the original game and instead places you behind the wheel of a car across a stretch of nearly spotless countryside. Splatter zombies spewing gore and leave tire tracks in their guts as you drive across the fields, attempting daring jumps.

They can look stunning, particularly on the PS5 and Xbox Series X, and they can overwhelm with interesting new twists on the tried-and-true shooter concept. They often put us against brainy villains and those who wish to devour them. And they never fail to wow with their speed and flair.</p><p>While talking about Best Fps Games’ first-person shooters are one of the most popular game genres, picking the top 30 examples is difficult. We need a set of laws, but even then, another ten are killed by a headshot for every gunman who makes it through. On this list, we’ll look at games with first-person shooting as their main mechanic. In 2021, the game should be playable right now. Multiplayer FPS and first-person battle royales are hot, while first-person action RPGs like Fallout 4 and action-adventure games like Deathloop are out and known as best Fps games. These are the guidelines. Shooting the messenger isn’t a good idea.</p><p>Without further ado, here are the 7 best Fps games available right now.</p><h3 id="1-BLACK-MESA"><a href="#1-BLACK-MESA" class="headerlink" title="1.BLACK MESA"></a>1.BLACK MESA</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/black-mesa-poster.jpg"                      alt="black-mesa-poster"                ></p><p>Black Mesa is just a fan-made Half-Life 1 remake that runs on the latest Source engine. Black Mesa took 15 years to achieve version 1.0, but it’s well worth waiting when it was released in 2020. To offer a more condensed experience, the remake is a revised version of the classic single-player campaign, with no outdated puzzles or battle sequences. The crew also created an enhanced version of Alien planet Xen, ostensibly cut from Half-Life 1’s last chapter.</p><p>Although there’s no denying the Half-Life 1 is just a great game, particularly in light of what it achieved for PC gaming, its gameplay isn’t without flaws, which are addressed in Black Mesa. Black Mesa is the greatest way to see what you’ve been losing out on if you haven’t experienced the original Half-Life game. Black MESA is included in this list of the greatest FPS games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Recreation of Half-Life.</p><p>• More concise experience.</p><h3 id="2-CALL-OF-DUTY-COLD-WAR-BLACK-OPS"><a href="#2-CALL-OF-DUTY-COLD-WAR-BLACK-OPS" class="headerlink" title="2.CALL OF DUTY: COLD WAR BLACK OPS"></a>2.CALL OF DUTY: COLD WAR BLACK OPS</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-of-duty-cold-war-black-ops.jpg"                      alt="call-of-duty-cold-war-black-ops"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135401/19272" target="_top" id="2135401">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135401" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135401/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Following the success of the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare reboot and Warzone, Black Ops – Cold War needed to live up to Infinity Ward’s expectations.

You’ll be up against gamers who have been roaming these maps for almost a decade. You’ll be killed by snipers who have tens of thousands of kills on their Scout. Players that can memorize CS: GO console instructions in their sleep will punish you by forcing you to sit out the remainder of the round while you regret your error.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Contemporary military meat grinder.</p><p>• Sniping hype.</p><h3 id="5-HALF-LIFE-2"><a href="#5-HALF-LIFE-2" class="headerlink" title="5.HALF-LIFE 2"></a>5.HALF-LIFE 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/half-life-2-poster.jpg"                      alt="half-life-2-poster"                ></p><p>Half-Life 2 is often regarded as one of the greatest PC games of all time, and it is so much more than an extension of its brilliant predecessor. These honors are also well-deserved. Half-Life 2 is a tremendously ambitious game that benefits from being created by a much more confident valve.</p><p>Everything is larger this time around than in 1998: the settings, the adversaries, the narrative - it’s a blockbuster but a smart one. There are excellent AI partners; genuine people that exist to do more than die hilariously; and mechanics that make the environment feel real and substantial.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Tremendously ambitious game.</p><p>• The blockbuster environment feels.</p><h3 id="6-Escape-from-TARKOV"><a href="#6-Escape-from-TARKOV" class="headerlink" title="6.Escape from TARKOV"></a>6.Escape from TARKOV</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/escape-from-tarkov.jpg"                      alt="escape-from-tarkov"                ></p><p>There are a lot of FPS games that claim to be realistic, but none compare to Escape from Tarkov’s dev team’s fanatical attention to detail when it comes to weapons, attachments, and ballistics modeling. Not only are there over 60 weapons in Escape from Tarkov, but each one may be modified or stripped down to the point of being unrecognizable from its off-the-shelf equivalents. For each ammunition type, you may change barrels, mounts, scopes, flashlights, foregrips, pistol grips, handguards, muzzle attachments, stocks, charging handles, magazines, receivers, and gas blocks as well as select from a variety of cartridge kinds. These reasons are enough for this game to make a place in the best Fps games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Realistic modeling.</p><p>• Unrecognizable from its off-the-shelf equivalents.</p><h3 id="7-TITANFALL-2"><a href="#7-TITANFALL-2" class="headerlink" title="7.TITANFALL 2"></a>7.TITANFALL 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/titanfall-2.jpg"                      alt="titanfall-2"                ></p><p>EA and Respawn improved on what the original game did well, and the multiplayer in this shooter sequel was so perfectly balanced that it became one of the best Fps games of 2016. Titanfall 2’s mix of gritty, industrial mech brawling and agile pilot combat is unparalleled. The solo mode of Titanfall 2 also offers a great introduction to the game’s mechanics and a fascinating, self-contained story, as you’ll discover in our Titanfall 2 campaign review.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Perfectly balanced.</p><p>• Self-contained story.</p><p><a href="#">Try It Free</a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a href="#">Try It Free</a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p>Black Mesa is just a fan-made Half-Life 1 remake that runs on the latest Source engine.

There are excellent AI partners; genuine people that exist to do more than die hilariously; and mechanics that make the environment feel real and substantial.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Tremendously ambitious game.</p><p>• The blockbuster environment feels.</p><h3 id="6-Escape-from-TARKOV-3"><a href="#6-Escape-from-TARKOV-3" class="headerlink" title="6.Escape from TARKOV"></a>6.Escape from TARKOV</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/escape-from-tarkov.jpg"                      alt="escape-from-tarkov"                ></p><p>There are a lot of FPS games that claim to be realistic, but none compare to Escape from Tarkov’s dev team’s fanatical attention to detail when it comes to weapons, attachments, and ballistics modeling. Not only are there over 60 weapons in Escape from Tarkov, but each one may be modified or stripped down to the point of being unrecognizable from its off-the-shelf equivalents. For each ammunition type, you may change barrels, mounts, scopes, flashlights, foregrips, pistol grips, handguards, muzzle attachments, stocks, charging handles, magazines, receivers, and gas blocks as well as select from a variety of cartridge kinds. These reasons are enough for this game to make a place in the best Fps games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Realistic modeling.</p><p>• Unrecognizable from its off-the-shelf equivalents.</p><h3 id="7-TITANFALL-2-3"><a href="#7-TITANFALL-2-3" class="headerlink" title="7.TITANFALL 2"></a>7.TITANFALL 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/titanfall-2.jpg"                      alt="titanfall-2"                ></p><p>EA and Respawn improved on what the original game did well, and the multiplayer in this shooter sequel was so perfectly balanced that it became one of the best Fps games of 2016.
