The MMO industry generates 10 billion dollars a year and reaches audiences much larger than that. You can find plenty of both free MMORPG games and paid MMORPG’s. World of Warcraft, for example, has players who have cumulatively spent more time on Azeroth than the human species has existed on this planet for 6 million years. The underlying idea behind all these big numbers is a simple one: anyone, anywhere, can become anything in this virtual world (and grind out some loot along the way).</p><p>Unlike the text-based multi-user dungeons from which MMOs evolved, today’s MMOs are incredibly sophisticated. These games offer the best of the genre, be it as humanoid cats or as ruthless dictators. We’ve rounded up the best online games you can play today to celebrate that awesome lineage—and help you find the one that is worth your time. To make things simpler, we’ve also categorized them to give you a good idea of what makes each game exceptional. Also, we will share a list of free MMORPG games, so you don’t need to worry about paying anything to play these games.</p><p> You can check <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Clicker Games to Kill time&gt;&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="1-World-of-Warcraft"><a href="#1-World-of-Warcraft" class="headerlink" title="1. World of Warcraft"></a><strong>1. World of Warcraft</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>Understandably, you may think the world of Warcraft isn’t a free MMORPG. So why is it listed? You can play the first 20 levels of the game for free, and since 20 levels mean a lot of time in World of Warcraft, you should have no problem playing it all. It is for this reason that it has been included on this list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/world-of-warcraft-poster.jpg"                      alt="world-of-warcraft-poster"                ></p><p>There are not many people who are unfamiliar with the world of Warcraft. It’s a game that’s synonymous with the MMORPG genre. It offers players an expansive, ever-expanding universe filled with content to discover. All the elements of a quality MMORPG are present in this game, such as character customization, a persistent open world, and a compelling storyline. Getting started with World of Warcraft should be your top priority if you haven’t done so already. A game like this shouldn’t be missed.</p><h4 id="2-Guild-Wars-2"><a href="#2-Guild-Wars-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Guild Wars 2"></a><strong>2. Guild Wars 2</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>Another free MMORPG for beginners to start with, Guild Wars 2, has an interesting storyline that changes based on your decisions. You won’t find that in other games of its kind. As with most other MMORPGs, the game includes general features like character customization, crafting, and strong PvP and PvP elements.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/guild-wars-2-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>It takes place in the fantasy world of Tyria and lets players explore a vast persistent world alone or with friends. As part of Guild Wars 2’s story, there are also a number of instanced environments that players will encounter. Guild Wars 2’s dynamic action-based mechanic makes leveling up far more enjoyable than World of Warcraft, which is sometimes considered a grind. If you’re tired of the monotony of leveling up in other MMORPGs, this game is for you.</p><h4 id="3-Secret-Worlds-Legends"><a href="#3-Secret-Worlds-Legends" class="headerlink" title="3. Secret Worlds Legends"></a><strong>3. Secret Worlds Legends</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>Secret World Legends is another recent convert to the free-to-play model. The game is defined at least partly by its setting, which is the stuff of conspiracy theory crackpots’ dreams (or their worst nightmares). A world shrouded in mystery and filled with supernatural horrors is characterized by secret societies, mythological creatures, and evil cults. This game’s events are given a dramatic sweeping sweep by some killer sound design, which effectively amps up the tension.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/secret-worlds-legends-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>The game’s dedication to storytelling is one of its strongest features. Instead of the standard MMO trope of allowing players to queue up an out-of-control number of quests with no sense of overarching purpose, the Secret World focuses on a small number of quests at a time with clearly defined goals. The game’s narrative is emphasized by narrowing the focus, and its writing and atmosphere are showcased, which is of a fairly uniform high quality.</p><h4 id="4-Star-Conflict"><a href="#4-Star-Conflict" class="headerlink" title="4. Star Conflict"></a><strong>4. Star Conflict</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms</strong>: Windows, Xbox One</p><p>Try Star Conflict if you like space exploration. The free MMORPG puts you in the role of a space pilot seeking out alien treasures scattered all over its expansive universe. During Star Conflict, you are tasked with collecting various spaceships, for example, fighters or massive satellites that you can float in space.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/star-conflict-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>There are a variety of PvE quests and raids in the game, where you have to fight alien squadrons and space pirates and PvP while floating around in outer space in your spaceship. You can also customize your spaceship using various weapon types or ship modules organized under a tech tree. Another great feature of Star Conflict is that it allows players to experience the game in virtual reality with Oculus Rift.</p><h4 id="5-Skyforge"><a href="#5-Skyforge" class="headerlink" title="5. Skyforge"></a><strong>5. Skyforge</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows</p><p>Throughout your apotheosis, you become a god, gaining followers, and ascending to godhood in a sci-fi world fully equipped with advanced technology. That’s true, all those words do not typically go together, but let’s not give up just yet. When you can make your own god in Skyforge, why be a mere minion in a vast world filled with other loot-grinders?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skyforge-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>Unlike many typical MMOs, Skyforge offers players the ability to change their class at any time, so matchmaking is smooth and level progression is no longer necessary. In the prestige system, characters are ranked according to their general stats rather than by leveling up. Skyforge offers a nice diversion from other MMO’s grind by changing traditional MMO systems, offering a fascinating sci-fi world, and offering action-oriented combat.</p><h4 id="6-DC-Universe-Online"><a href="#6-DC-Universe-Online" class="headerlink" title="6. DC Universe Online"></a><strong>6. DC Universe Online</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One</p><p>DC Universe Online, an online MMORPG with custom abilities, offers the opportunity to build your own superhero and play with well-known heroes from the DC multiverse, such as Wonder Woman, Superman and Batman, among others.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dc-universe-online-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>In addition to its unique combat tab-targeting system which makes it stand out from other games on this list, it also makes the game more user-friendly for players. As well as having a captivating storyline, cool gear to collect, and levels that allow players to choose how they want to progress in the game, DC Universe Online offers many other features that will appeal to gamers.</p><h4 id="7-Lord-of-the-Rings-Online"><a href="#7-Lord-of-the-Rings-Online" class="headerlink" title="7. Lord of the Rings Online"></a><strong>7. Lord of the Rings Online</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>The Lord of the Rings Online is an MMORPG based in the impeccably detailed LOTR universe that is perfect for fans of medieval fantasy and Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings. With the game, players go on a journey across Middle Earth, fighting alongside familiar characters and exploring locations such as those in the movies.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lord-of-the-rings-online-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>There is just one small exception to the gameplay of Lord of the Rings Online, but it’s no different than any other MMORPG on this list. There are no large scale PvP opportunities in LOTR Online, since all characters in the game are on the same side. It instead provides players with a Monster Play mode that allows them to create a monster at level ten and battle other players within Ettenmoor.</p><h4 id="8-Star-Trek-Online"><a href="#8-Star-Trek-Online" class="headerlink" title="8. Star Trek Online"></a><strong>8. Star Trek Online</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC</p><p>In addition to its solid license, Star Trek Online offers a rich and unique gameplay experience that is unbeatable in the MMO market. With its spaceships and aliens, and a consistent blend of third-person shooter and naval simulator, Space Truckers Online is an addictive game that will keep you hooked with its spaceships and aliens.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/star-trek-online-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>Many familiar elements are found in the series and films that are as enjoyable to discover as they sound. Fan service is done right in Star Trek: The Original Series by blowing up borg cubes, strolling Deep Space Nine’s promenade, or beaming down to exotic planets as part of an away team. A new story expansion on the Alpha Quadrant, launching at the end of January, offers new gameplay content set in a previously unexplored sector, as well as a number of recent limited-time events and minigames.</p><h4 id="9-ArcheAge"><a href="#9-ArcheAge" class="headerlink" title="9. ArcheAge"></a><strong>9. ArcheAge</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>You can do pretty much anything in ArcheAge, a medieval fantasy game that takes you to a medieval fantasy world. If you want to be a powerful warrior, you can do so with a huge sword of your own and a big group of friends at your side, or you can become an economics expert and take on the challenges of farming and trade. As a pirate, you can rob traders and plunder their goods.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/archeage-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>Additionally, Mounts and Travel play an important role in ArcheAge. On top of riding wild animals such as lions and deer across its colossal world, you can also take to the air and sea. You can sail the oceans in anything from rowboats to warships, and there are also aerial modes of transportation like gliders and airships. Archeage shows how dedicated Trion is (and the resources that they have available to them) in its polish and longevity.</p><h4 id="10-EVE-Online"><a href="#10-EVE-Online" class="headerlink" title="10. EVE Online"></a><strong>10. EVE Online</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>EVE Online is still the premier space MMO, and it has been the source of many memorable gaming stories, owing to the way it focuses on a few elements and excels at them. As well as meticulous simulations and systems, CCP pays attention to its dedicated community and responds appropriately, as it is often their subscribers who make the decisions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/eve-online-poster.jpg"                      alt="eve-online-poster"                ></p><p>Although detractors dismiss EVE as spreadsheets in space, the criticism highlights one of its strongest points: its real and thriving economy. It is said that in-game intrigue has spilled over into the real world on occasion, as the corporations and alliances in EVE take their business very seriously. No other game can compare with EVE Online’s depth, nuance, complicated diplomacy, and expansive space battles.</p><h4 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h4><p>There are countless free MMORPG games that you can find online, but the above-mentioned are some of the best games we picked for you.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Commanders’-Conclave-Celebrating-the-Best-of-7-Total-Wars"><a href="#Commanders’-Conclave-Celebrating-the-Best-of-7-Total-Wars" class="headerlink" title="Commanders’ Conclave: Celebrating the Best of 7 Total Wars"></a>Commanders’ Conclave: Celebrating the Best of 7 Total Wars</h2><p>It’s a tough task to choose the best total war games. Everyone has a favorite—the game that first introduced them to the series or allowed them to immerse themselves in a historical era they’d always been fascinated with. When you find a historical era you didn’t even know much about, as I did through Shogun 2 &amp; Three Kingdoms, it sparks your interest.</p><p>Warhammer 3 introduces survival combat, a fresh Three Kingdoms game is announced, Saga: Troy tries mythology on it for size, the franchise is expanding in more ways than ever before. Classics, though, are still available. One of the most compelling aspects is that, despite their differences, they all have a sense of cohesiveness. You can dive into anything and always find something in common.</p><p>For many individuals, Total War has a special place in their hearts, and it’s always enjoyable to go back and play games from the series whenever the mood strikes. I’m constantly attracted back to films like Attila, Fall of the Samurai, and Rome 2, to name a few. Regardless of whatever one you favor, they all provide a similar combination of struggle and failure, conquest, and dominance.</p><p>The Best Total War games on their own are listed here.</p><h3 id="1-Attila-the-Hun"><a href="#1-Attila-the-Hun" class="headerlink" title="1.Attila the Hun"></a>1.Attila the Hun</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/attila-the-hun-poster.png"                      alt="attila-the-hun-poster"                ></p><p>Napoleon aspired to be Attila the Hun. At the time of its release, Attila’s primary goal was to fix Rome 2’s flaws and stripped-down features, since it seemed like the game was going down the same road as Empire. Attila, on the other hand, proved to be more than that, because it not only reintroduced promised features but also innovated, iterated, and expanded the brand.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Dramatic perspective.</p><p>• Ominous franchise.</p><h3 id="2-Rome-2-Total-War"><a href="#2-Rome-2-Total-War" class="headerlink" title="2.Rome 2 Total War"></a>2.Rome 2 Total War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rome-2-total-war-poster.png"                      alt="rome-2-total-war-poster"                ></p><p>Unlike its predecessor, Rome 2, which was released in 2004, the time has been very kind with Rome 2 &amp;, as a consequence, it may be called a surprise success for CA. Rome 2 had a disastrous debut, similar to Empire, and it took a year for it to become genuinely playable. CA, on the other hand, stuck it out and won their first genuine AAA Total War.</p><p>Apart from the largely forgotten rough launch problems and many contentious design choices, Rome 2 has left an unresolved black stain on the Total War series that still exists today: chronic feature stripping, particularly in multiplayer. Regardless, Rome 2 is a fascinating revisit to Ancient Rome, though it took a long time to get there—after all, Rome was not built in a day.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Gore &amp; Blood.</p><p>• State of Greek culture pack.</p><p>• Raider and Pirates culture pack.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.bitdefender.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=BITLATIN&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2Fbusiness%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3D30%2525%2BOff%2Ball%2BGravityZone%2BProducts"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.bitdefender.com/content/dam/bitdefender/business/campaign/1200X628.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Three-Kingdoms-Total-War"><a href="#3-Three-Kingdoms-Total-War" class="headerlink" title="3.Three Kingdoms: Total War"></a>3.Three Kingdoms: Total War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/three-kingdom-total-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="three-kingdom-total-war-poster"                ></p><p>Three Kingdoms has been the most recent mainline of the best total war games, and in my opinion, it’s also the most honest. The game devotes itself entirely to a dramatized, idealized, and cinematic depiction in Ancient Chinese history (the first in the series), relying mainly on the Love rather than the Three Kingdoms Records. I wouldn’t be shocked if the upcoming best total war games took a more hands-on approach.</p><p>However, there are several flaws with it. Unfortunately, the tactical layer continues to be hampered by the simpler Thrones of Brittania’s financial and building system, and the campaign is poorly paced owing to the campaign map’s sheer vastness and stretched-out primary goals. The most serious problem is the absence of multiplayer service and support. Even though here is where CA may locate gold, it was almost dead when it arrived. Three Kingdoms is, in the end, a sprawling, rich, and thrilling retelling of a violent era in Chinese history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Focused on character.</p><p>• Story and setting.</p><p>• Diplomacy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="1080" height="1620" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:1080px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall<p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-saga-samurai-fall.jpg"                      alt="total-war-saga-samurai-fall"                ></p><p>Ironically, the greatest Saga game was never intended to be a Saga game. Fall of the Samurai (later renamed as a Saga game) was released as a standalone addition for Shogun 2, transporting players to the lesser-known Meiji Restoration era in Japanese history, when pro-Imperial and pro-Shogunate armies fought for Japan’s destiny.</p><p>As close-quarters oriented samurai fight against and besides modern firearms-equipped soldiers, the campaign’s theme of tradition vs. modernity creates intriguing combat dynamics. This gives the tactical gameplay a fascinating twist and complexity that matches Shogun 2’s meticulous balance. The fall of the Samurai is certainly worth checking out as a historical development and improvement of Shogun 2.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Dramatic Clash.</p><p>• Modern weaponry.</p><p>• Explosive power.</p><h3 id="5-Warhammer-2"><a href="#5-Warhammer-2" class="headerlink" title="5.Warhammer 2"></a>5.Warhammer 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warhammer2-poster.jpg"                      alt="warhammer2-poster"                ></p><p>With a stronger narrative emphasis and more engaging factions and systems, Warhammer 2 builds on the original’s legacy and influence of the best total war games series.</p><p>Warhammer 2 has all of the features that made Warhammer so popular, as well as tweaks to the balance and additional post-release material and updates. The Mortal Empires’ adventure, which merges the strategic landscapes from the first and two seasons into one huge super campaign, is perhaps Warhammer 2’s most significant feature. However, as a result of this, Warhammer 2 swallows the first, rendering Warhammer insignificant as a gaming experience.</p><p>This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for any Warhammer enthusiast. What’s also cool to see, particularly in the post-launch support, is that both CA &amp; Games Workshop put out the effort to create new components, whether they’re units, heroes, or mythology, and add them to the games, indicating a real interest in using this framework for franchise development.

The game devotes itself entirely to a dramatized, idealized, and cinematic depiction in Ancient Chinese history (the first in the series), relying mainly on the Love rather than the Three Kingdoms Records. I wouldn’t be shocked if the upcoming best total war games took a more hands-on approach.</p><p>However, there are several flaws with it. Unfortunately, the tactical layer continues to be hampered by the simpler Thrones of Brittania’s financial and building system, and the campaign is poorly paced owing to the campaign map’s sheer vastness and stretched-out primary goals. The most serious problem is the absence of multiplayer service and support. Even though here is where CA may locate gold, it was almost dead when it arrived. Three Kingdoms is, in the end, a sprawling, rich, and thrilling retelling of a violent era in Chinese history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Focused on character.</p><p>• Story and setting.</p><p>• Diplomacy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892108/21290" target="_top" id="1892108"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892108"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892108/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Total-War-Saga-Samurai-Fall"><a href="#4-Total-War-Saga-Samurai-Fall" class="headerlink" title="4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall"></a>4.Total War Saga: Samurai Fall</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/total-war-saga-samurai-fall.jpg"                      alt="total-war-saga-samurai-fall"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4694919&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bccefcc1b1eee9eca3ae4f5c1a281482/products/jutoh-logo-1200x1600.jpg"                      border="0"                >Jutoh is an ebook creator for Epub, Kindle and more.

While Shogun 2 isn't exactly a AAA cost game (I'd call it an AA or AA.5), it has the feel of one. Even though Shogun 2 lacks some of the previous games' large landscapes or faction variety, the general performance of the gameplay and features that interact with one another, as well as several quality-of-life improvements, making it the finest game within the list of best total war games.<p>The inclusion of the Avatar Invasion multiplayer mode was Shogun 2’s biggest success, but it was not as busy or famous as that at launch. The game’s already high quality in the tactical campaign and battles, coupled with a genuinely unique multiplayer structure, demonstrate that there is a happy medium between keeping what works and introducing something new. Total Wars in the modern era have failed to achieve the same heights as Shogun 2. This game is recommended not only as a fantastic Total War game, but as a fantastic strategy game that will go down in history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Chosokabe Clan.</p><p>• Army lead.</p><p>• Even beginners can benefit from these tutorials.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-2"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-2" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/image/box/filmora-9.png"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.massmailsoftware.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1300375&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/dc87c13749315c7217cdc4ac692e704c/banera_for_partners-15_%281%29.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Napoleon aspired to be Attila the Hun.

Who’d have guessed that would suffice?</p><p>Of course, Medieval 2 has many of the same flaws as Rome, such as bad AI and pathfinding, but because there was no remake, it remains a game set in its period that is still remarkable even when compared with some of the most recent best total war games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Campaign mode.</p><p>• Battle focused.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3851655&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Shogun-2-Total-War-3"><a href="#7-Shogun-2-Total-War-3" class="headerlink" title="7.Shogun 2: Total War"></a>7.Shogun 2: Total War</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shogun2-total-war-poster.jpg"                      alt="shogun2-total-war-poster"                ></p><p>Finally, the apex of Total War, the meeting point and turning point among older and newer era Total Wars, and the example of Creative Assemblies at its height. While Shogun 2 isn’t exactly a AAA cost game (I’d call it an AA or AA.5), it has the feel of one. Even though Shogun 2 lacks some of the previous games’ large landscapes or faction variety, the general performance of the gameplay and features that interact with one another, as well as several quality-of-life improvements, making it the finest game within the list of best total war games.</p><p>The inclusion of the Avatar Invasion multiplayer mode was Shogun 2’s biggest success, but it was not as busy or famous as that at launch. The game’s already high quality in the tactical campaign and battles, coupled with a genuinely unique multiplayer structure, demonstrate that there is a happy medium between keeping what works and introducing something new. Total Wars in the modern era have failed to achieve the same heights as Shogun 2. This game is recommended not only as a fantastic Total War game, but as a fantastic strategy game that will go down in history.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Chosokabe Clan.</p><p>• Army lead.</p><p>• Even beginners can benefit from these tutorials.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More &gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/image/box/filmora-9.png"                                     ></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-engaging-audiences-the-path-to-instagram-video-fame/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Engaging Audiences  The Path to Instagram Video Fame</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-free-cam-screen-recorder-review-and-best-alternatives/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Free Cam Screen Recorder Review and Best Alternatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-iconic-instagram-aesthetics-compilation/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Iconic Instagram Aesthetics Compilation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-video-vanguard-showdown-which-is-worthier-obs-or-twitch-studio/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Video Vanguard Showdown  Which Is Worthier, OBS or Twitch Studio?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-divided-footage-delight-top-cam-discussion-in-2024/"><u>[New] Divided Footage Delight  Top Cam Discussion, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-efficient-gaming-footage-with-camcapture/"><u>[New] Efficient Gaming Footage with CamCapture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-ideal-screencasting-tools-for-enhancing-online-learning/"><u>[New] Ideal Screencasting Tools for Enhancing Online Learning</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-latest-idevice-screenshots-capture-hacks/"><u>[New] In 2024, Latest iDevice Screenshots Capture Hacks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-leap-into-instagram-stardom-with-ease/"><u>[New] In 2024, Leap Into Instagram Stardom with Ease</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-mastering-the-mystique-of-moonlit-portraits/"><u>[New] In 2024, Mastering the Mystique of Moonlit Portraits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-secure-and-quality-the-top-5-choice-of-recorders/"><u>[New] In 2024, Secure and Quality -

Running a session online can be a daunting task - with the right tools, information, and resources it can be smooth sailing. There are three main video conferencing apps available, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and an app that trumps them all - Google Meet.</p><p>Google Meet is a video calling app that comes fully equipped with numerous features, such as screen presenting.

Whether it is a meeting, online class, or brainstorming session, it becomes a whole lot easier with a PowerPoint slideshow - bringing everyone on the same page!</p><p>You must be wondering <strong>how to share ppt in Google Meet</strong>, well the process is fairly simple and extremely functional. You will only need two tools to execute this screen-sharing process, a web browser, and Microsoft PowerPoint. We would advise that you use Google Chrome as your web browser as it works best with Google Meet.</p><p>Just a heads up, when you are presenting your screen on Google Meet, everyone can see what you display, so it’s best to open up your PowerPoint slides before joining the meeting so there are no surprises!</p><ol><li>Open the Microsoft PowerPoint Slides on your laptop, the model or brand of the laptop does not matter, as long as you have Microsoft PowerPoint on it</li><li>Convert your slides from the default mode to browsed by an individual mode. If you have used Microsoft PowerPoint before, then you must know that in slideshow mode the slides appear in fullscreen making it difficult to switch between applications, therefore by converting the PowerPoint it will be windowed fullscreen, allowing the presenter to switch between applications. The process is simple, just click the “Slide Show” tab, then “Set Up Slide Show”, and from the drop-down menu press “Browsed by an Individual”.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/powerpoint-browsed-by-individual.jpg"                      alt="set PowerPoint to individual browse"                ></p><ol><li>After setting up the PowerPoint slides, move over to Google Meet and join the meeting through the meeting link provided or schedule in a new meeting. You have two options: either you can join the meeting and then share your slides, or share the PowerPoint while joining the session.

Here you have two options, one - you can join the session directly and then start presenting the screen, or two - share the screen and then join the session.</li></ol><p>If you decide to go with the latter option, then click the “Present” option. Since I’m using the Chrome browser, I will choose the slides tab to share. If you would like to share any audio, make sure to tick the share tab audio button as well!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-google-slides-tab-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="Share slides on Google Meet  "                ></p><ol><li>Once you have gone through these steps your Google Slides will automatically be visible to anyone and everyone in the Google Meet session.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Present-PowerPoint-or-Slides-in-Google-Meet-On-iPhone-and-iPad"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Present-PowerPoint-or-Slides-in-Google-Meet-On-iPhone-and-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Present PowerPoint or Slides in Google Meet On iPhone and iPad?"></a>Part 3: How to Present PowerPoint or Slides in Google Meet On iPhone and iPad?</h2><p>Wondering <strong>how to present ppt in Google Meet in iPhone</strong>?

Upon clicking “Start Broadcast” the screen will start to share in three seconds. Switch from Google Meet to PowerPoint or Google Slides and the screen will automatically share slides.</p><p>To be sure if the screen is being shared check the top of the iPhone or iPad and if there is a red stripe, it means the screen is being broadcasted to participants. Moreover, do not worry while switching apps, you will still be in the Google Meet session even if you go onto PowerPoint or Google Slides while sharing your screen on a mobile or tablet device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-screen-broadcast-share-powerpoint-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="Share slides on Google Meet on iPhone "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=40203538&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/cc4b82e826b52ec41c810301548e8f48/products/audio-to-text-transcription-software.png"                      border="0"                >EaseText Audio to Text Converter for Windows (Personal Edition) - An intelligent tool to transcribe &amp; convert audio to text freely </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4615471&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/affiliate-image/affiliate_banners_en/max_782x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Presenting-PowerPoint-or-Slides-in-Google-Meet-on-Android"><a href="#Part-4-Presenting-PowerPoint-or-Slides-in-Google-Meet-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Presenting PowerPoint or Slides in Google Meet on Android"></a>Part 4: Presenting PowerPoint or Slides in Google Meet on Android</h2><p>The process of presenting a PowerPoint or Google Slides during a Google Meet session on an android is very similar to that of an Apple device.</p><p>Step 1) You must open up your PowerPoint or Slides beforehand, while this is not necessary, it always makes the process more simple.</p><p>Step 2) Join into the Google Meet session, if you have been invited into the session then join using the joining link, if not then create a new meeting. If you would rather directly screen share instead of joining into the session first, then click the “Share Screen” option directly.</p><p>Step 3) Upon joining the meeting, click the “More” option and tap the “Present Screen” menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/present-screen-on-google-meet-android.jpg"                      alt="Share slides on Google Meet on Android "                ></p><p>Step 4) After that, allow presenting and go to your PowerPoint &#x2F; Google Slides to share them with participants, easy right?!

When a presenter is done sharing their PowerPoint slides they must stop sharing their screen as well. One easy way to do that is to leave the Google Meet session, however, that might not be so polite.</p><p>Instead, there is another way, upon finishing the discussion on the PowerPoint slides, click the stop presenting button which automatically appears on the bottom of the screen you are sharing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stop-powerpoint-sharing-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="stop PPT sharing on Google Meet "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920047/21774" target="_top" id="1920047"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920047"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920047/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>If that option is not visible to the presenter, they can return to their Google Meet session, and click the stop sharing button as shown in the image below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stop-google-meet-present.jpg"                      alt="stop  Google Meet present"                ></p><p>Moreover, if you are on an iPhone or iPad, you can simply click the red stripe on the top of your screen and a notification popup will appear indicating that you can stop presenting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/stop-powerpoint-present-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="stop  PPT present on Google Meet "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://newchic.sjv.io/c/5597632/1659704/14420" target="_top" id="1659704"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14420-1659704"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1659704/14420"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="FAQ-about-Presenting-PowerPoint-on-Google-Meet"><a href="#FAQ-about-Presenting-PowerPoint-on-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="FAQ about Presenting PowerPoint on Google Meet"></a>FAQ about Presenting PowerPoint on Google Meet</h2><ol><li><strong>Can others see you while you are presenting a PPT?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, if you have enabled the video option during the Google Meet session, then participants will be able to see you. Just because an individual starts presenting, their camera will not turn off automatically, unless it is turned off by them.</p><ol><li><strong>Can participants interact with your device while sharing a presentation?</strong></li></ol><p>No, participants cannot interact with your device while sharing a presentation. The screen is only being mirrored, therefore only the presenter has control over the device. Participants can only view it, not control the device.</p><ol><li><strong>Can you present when someone else is presenting?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, an individual can present when someone else is presenting. If you start presenting while someone else is already presenting, their screen presenting will pause and yours will start.</p><p><strong>Are You Ready to Present PPT on Google Meet?</strong></p><p>Presenting a ppt on Google Meet is not all that difficult, if you know what to do, how to do it, and when to do it, then you are good to go. Google Meet is a video conferencing tool created to ease virtual communication and make it more functional. So, if you were wondering <strong>how to share slides in Google Meet</strong>, well we hope you got the answer!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

If Zoom is configured to accept sounds from system audio, the mic sends the signals back to the speakers that again send the audio output to the mic. Since this iteration never ends, you continuously hear an audio feedback loop.</p><h5 id="How-to-Resolve-the-Audio-Loop-in-Zoom-Meeting"><a href="#How-to-Resolve-the-Audio-Loop-in-Zoom-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to Resolve the Audio Loop in Zoom Meeting?"></a>How to Resolve the Audio Loop in Zoom Meeting?</h5><p>In order to eliminate this issue, make sure to place both microphone and speakers at a safe distance from each other. This would prevent the microphone from receiving any output from the speakers, and the chain of audio feedback loop would never take place.</p><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-2-Background-Noise"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-2-Background-Noise" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 2: Background Noise"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 2: Background Noise</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It-1"><a href="#What-Is-It-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p>Background noise is the distortion or humming that you hear during an audio call on zoom.</p><h5 id="Why-I-hear-background-noise-in-Zoom-Meeting"><a href="#Why-I-hear-background-noise-in-Zoom-Meeting" class="headerlink" title="Why I hear background noise in Zoom Meeting?"></a>Why I hear background noise in Zoom Meeting?</h5><p>If you have a highly sensitive microphone that is mostly used by professionals or in recording studios, the chances are that it will catch a lot of background noise during a Zoom meeting.</p><h5 id="How-to-remove-the-background-noise-in-Zoom-meeting"><a href="#How-to-remove-the-background-noise-in-Zoom-meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to remove the background noise in Zoom meeting?"></a>How to remove the background noise in Zoom meeting?</h5><p>This issue can be resolved by either hosting or joining a meeting in a closed, soundproof room, or using a less sensitive mic. It would be best if you use a normal headset that is easily available in any local electronic shop. You can also try enabling the <strong>Automatically adjust volume</strong> option from the <strong>Microphone</strong> section of the <strong>Audio</strong> category of the <strong>Settings</strong> box as explained earlier in <strong>Step 3</strong> of the <strong>Zoom Audio Settings When Not in Meeting</strong> section.</p><h4 id="Zoom-Audio-Issue-3-Echo"><a href="#Zoom-Audio-Issue-3-Echo" class="headerlink" title="Zoom Audio Issue 3: Echo"></a>Zoom Audio Issue 3: Echo</h4><h5 id="What-Is-It-2"><a href="#What-Is-It-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is It?"></a>What Is It?</h5><p><strong>Zoom audio echo</strong> is when you hear an echo sound during an ongoing Zoom meeting with audio enabled.</p><h5 id="How-It-Happens-1"><a href="#How-It-Happens-1" class="headerlink" title="How It Happens?"></a>How It Happens?</h5><p>Echo happens when you are on a laptop and are using onboard speakers and microphone, and that too with the speaker or mic volume set to maximum.</p><h5 id="How-to-remove-the-echo-in-the-Zoom-meeting"><a href="#How-to-remove-the-echo-in-the-Zoom-meeting" class="headerlink" title="How to remove the echo in the Zoom meeting?"></a>How to remove the echo in the Zoom meeting?</h5><p>As mentioned earlier, it is always advisable to use a headset to avoid any such unwanted echo or audio feedback loop issues. In case you don’t have access to a headset, try configuring the microphone settings to automatically adjust the volume, and not putting the speaker volume to the max.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Configuring <strong>Zoom audio settings</strong> before hosting or joining a meeting is always a wise approach to avoid any audio inconsistencies during an ongoing conference.

Kazam allows you to record in different document designs (WEBM, AVI, MP4 and others). For staying away from the capacity issue while recording, the most ideal choice is the MP4. I additionally unequivocally suggest staying away from the RAW (AVI) design (except if you’re completely mindful of what you’re doing) as even the recording several minutes can create GBs of recorded information. There is additionally another choice present for taking screen captures in Kazam. At the point when you start screen recording,</p><p>The main serious issue with Kazam is the absence of help for recording through a webcam. Even though, in case you simply need to utilize Kazam for catching screens and taking screen captures, it is the best decision for fledglings. Kazam is an extraordinary screen recorder that is extremely simple to learn. Kazam is genuinely a monster as far as elements and effortlessness. It offers the most exquisite method of recording for any Linux distro. Notwithstanding not being refreshed for some time, Kazam manages the land.

Our Take on Kazam Ubuntu Recorder</h2><p>Not at all like most screen recording programs for Linux, Kazam is amazing in its altering&#x2F;trading choices (in a perfect, decent graphical UI), works with a norm, simple to-alter design, however, it isn’t without its disadvantages. Kazam allows you to record in different document designs (WEBM, AVI, MP4 and others). For staying away from the capacity issue while recording, the most ideal choice is the MP4. I additionally unequivocally suggest staying away from the RAW (AVI) design (except if you’re completely mindful of what you’re doing) as even the recording several minutes can create GBs of recorded information. There is additionally another choice present for taking screen captures in Kazam. At the point when you start screen recording,</p><p>The main serious issue with Kazam is the absence of help for recording through a webcam. Even though, in case you simply need to utilize Kazam for catching screens and taking screen captures, it is the best decision for fledglings.

The workplace communication needs are evolving significantly and every one of us, individuals, companies, and organizations need to adapt promptly to the new ways of collaborating. Advanced technologies have now made it possible to <strong>make a group chat</strong> with family, friends, school, and coworkers to constantly stay updated with the latest family happenings or the progress of a particular project you’re working on. <strong>Skype group chat</strong> allows you to swiftly send messages, videos, pictures, etc. to multiple people at once while constantly apprising the group members of the latest events and developments. In this article, you will learn:</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: Make a Skype Group Chat on Windows</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: Start a Skype Group Chat on Mac</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part 3: Manage Your Skype Group Chat</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part4"><strong>Part 4: Q&amp;A about Skype Group Chat</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Make-a-Skype-Group-Chat-on-Windows"><a href="#Part-1-Make-a-Skype-Group-Chat-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Make a Skype Group Chat on Windows"></a>Part 1: Make a Skype Group Chat on Windows</h2><p>Communicating with multiple people simultaneously from different parts of the world in real-time couldn’t be thought of some years ago. However, today Skype group chat makes it possible for anyone to connect and collaborate with several people without any barriers and limitations.</p><p>To make a group chat on Skype using a Windows operating system you can get connected with individuals from diverse localities of the world within a minute. To make a Skype group chat for yourself follow along with the steps below.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.skype.com/"><strong>Download Skype</strong></a> on your Windows PC. You’ll need to sign in with a Microsoft account or sign up if you haven’t already had a Skype account.</li><li>Once you’ve logged in to Skype you’ll be presented with a similar interface with “Recent Chats” showing up in the left pane. To make a group chat click on the drop-down icon next to the “New Chat” button and select “New Group Chat” and your new Skype group chat is only a few clicks away.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-group-chat1.jpg"                      alt="new group chat"                ></p><ul><li>A new window will appear in the Skype main screen. Here you’ll have to write the name of the group and select a picture for the group chat. The name should represent the purpose of the chat group to make sense to its participants, I’ve selected a figurative name for the sake of an example. After you’re done with the name and picture, press the ahead arrow.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-group-name2.jpg"                      alt="create group name"                ></p><ul><li>Skype will take you to your contact list to choose the members for your new chat group. You can skimp through the whole list or search the name in the search bar to look for a particular person. Once you’re done selecting all your contacts press the “Done” button and Skype will create your new shiny group within a minute.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/finish-create-group3.jpg"                      alt="finish create group"                ></p><ul><li>You’ll be taken directly to the new group chat you just created. Here you can chat with all the group members at the same time without any delay. Send pictures, videos, schedule a group call, add more people to the group, and many more features.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-group-chat4.jpg"                      alt="start group chat"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Start-a-Skype-Group-Chat-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-Start-a-Skype-Group-Chat-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Start a Skype Group Chat on Mac"></a>Part 2: Start a Skype Group Chat on Mac</h2><p>Skype allows anyone to create a group chat on Mac. You can easily create and enjoy your Skype group chat with the simple steps below.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.skype.com/"><strong>Download Skype</strong></a> on your Mac system and sign in with your Microsoft account.</li><li>On the home page of Skype, you need to press and open the drop-down menu right next to the “New Chat” notepad icon. From the list select the “New Group Chat” option to get started creating your Skype group chat.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-new-chat1.jpg"                      alt="select new chat"                ></p><ul><li>A new window will pop up for you to determine the group name and picture. Choose a name that best describes the purpose of the group, as in our case it’s a dummy chat group, so I named it “Skype group chat”. Once you’ve done press the forward arrow button.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-group-name2.jpg"                      alt="get group name"                ></p><ul><li>You’ll be taken to your “Contact List” to choose the contacts you want to add to the group.

Generally, to delete a contact you’ll have to view the person’s profile details and then press the “Remove from contact list” option, but here I’ll be showing you a fairly easy and simple way to delete all your contacts at once.</p><p>To delete all your Skype contacts at once follow the steps:</p><ul><li>1.

If you would like to make sure that your webcam videos are always captured in the best quality possible, then you should consider purchasing an external webcam. However, before you reach the decision which webcam model you want to buy there are a few things you should take into consideration.</p><p>The quality of the video you’ll be able to create depends on the maximum resolution your webcam can produce. If video quality is really important to you, our advice is to acquire a webcam that can create a video in <strong>1280X960P</strong> <strong>resolution</strong> or higher.</p><p><strong>Frame rate</strong> ensures that your videos will always look smooth and that’s the reason why your webcam should produce <strong>at least 25 frames per second</strong>. Furthermore, the sound quality is as important as video quality, which is why you should make sure that your webcam has a built-in microphone capable of capturing clear high-quality sound or you should external microphone is necessary.</p><p>The <strong>connection options</strong> the webcam of your choice offers should play a part in your decision-making process, especially if you intend to create webcam videos from a desktop computer. Features such as <strong>mounting options</strong> or <strong>auto zoom</strong> should also be considered before purchasing a webcam.</p><p>Users in need of a high-quality webcam capable of remarkable performances should try using <a class="link"   href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/4k-pro-webcam" >Logitech 4K pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> webcam designed for video conferencing, video recording or streaming. This Logitech’s model comes equipped with 4K UHD video recording option, built-in mic, background replacement feature and numerous other options that make webcam video recording look simple.</p><p>On the other hand, if you are looking for a more affordable webcam then <a class="link"   href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/webcams/lifecam-hd-3000/t3h-00011" >Microsoft LifeCam HD 3000 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a near perfect choice for you.

Choose the camera angle carefully"></a>1. Choose the camera angle carefully</h4><p>Unlike conventional videos, most webcam videos are recorded from a single camera position. You should place the camera at the straight angle since this type of camera position is frequently used in tutorials, software walkthroughs or gaming videos. However, if you choose a low-angle or a high-angle shot, make sure that the subject of the shot is placed at the very center of the frame.</p><h4 id="2-Make-sure-that-there-is-enough-light-in-the-shot"><a href="#2-Make-sure-that-there-is-enough-light-in-the-shot" class="headerlink" title="2. Make sure that there is enough light in the shot"></a>2. Make sure that there is enough light in the shot</h4><p>The importance of good lighting in a webcam video is often overlooked. Although using professional lighting equipment during a webcam video production may not be necessary, it is still important that a person or objects in the video are properly lit. You can combine atmospheric sources of light with artificial ones such as common lamps or LED spotlights.</p><h4 id="3-Use-an-external-microphone"><a href="#3-Use-an-external-microphone" class="headerlink" title="3.Use an external microphone"></a>3.Use an <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >external microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Most webcams of the latest generation have a built-in microphone, but if you would like to be sure that your voiceover is impeccable, we suggest using an external shotgun microphone. This type of microphone rejects atmospheric noises from 30 degrees on both sides, while perfectly capturing the sounds coming directly from the front.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://lightailing.sjv.io/c/5597632/1725213/17190" target="_top" id="1725213"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17190-1725213"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1000"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1725213/17190"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Video-Editor-for-Editing-the-Recorded-Webcam-Video"><a href="#Best-Video-Editor-for-Editing-the-Recorded-Webcam-Video" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editor for Editing the Recorded Webcam Video"></a>Best Video Editor for Editing the Recorded Webcam Video</h2><p>Despite being one of the best screen and webcam recorders on the market, the video editing options Filmora Scrn offers still lack the depth of more advanced video editing software products.

So here are some ways to <strong>remove background noise</strong> and improve the voice quality in Skype video calls.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1:</strong> How to Avoid Background Noise Before Skype Video Calls</a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2:</strong> How to Remove Background Noise After a Recording Was Done</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Avoid-Background-Noise-Before-a-Skype-Video-Call"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Avoid-Background-Noise-Before-a-Skype-Video-Call" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Avoid Background Noise Before a Skype Video Call"></a>Part 1: How to Avoid Background Noise Before a Skype Video Call</h2><p>Here we will discuss removing the background noise before a Skype video call. This can be done by adjusting your sound settings on the desktop as well as in the Skype application. Let’s see how:</p><ul><li>1. Turn on your desktop and tap the <strong>Sound</strong> icon at the right end of the Taskbar</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recording-device1.jpg"                      alt="recording-device1"                ></p><ul><li>2. Select the option <strong>Recording devices</strong></li><li>3. A small window will appear in which you have to Right-click on the   <strong>Microphone</strong>option and then select <strong>Properties</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/microphone-properties2.jpg"                      alt="microphone-properties2"                ></p><ul><li>4. Another window will appear, tap on the <strong>Levels</strong> at the top and adjust the <strong>Microphone Boost</strong> to 0.0dB and tap <strong>OK</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/microphone-boost3.jpg"                      alt="microphone-boost3"                ></p><ul><li>5. Now open Skype and click on the <strong>Tools</strong> option at the top. Select <strong>Options</strong> from it</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-options4.jpg"                      alt="skype-options4"                ></p><ul><li>6. A window will appear on the screen. Go to   <strong>Audio</strong> settings on the right side of the window</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-audio5.jpg"                      alt="skype-audio5"                ></p><ul><li>7. Now under the Microphone &amp; Volume, there will be a box stating <strong>Automatically adjust microphone settings</strong>. Uncheck the box and tap on Save to save the settings.</li></ul><p>Note:</p><p>Once you have done as stated above, you will experience a great reduction in the background noise as well as better quality while a Skype video call. Or you can also try the steps in this tutorial below to eliminate the background noise:</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Background-Noise-After-a-Recording-Was-Done"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Background-Noise-After-a-Recording-Was-Done" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Remove Background Noise After a Recording Was Done"></a>Part 2: How to Remove Background Noise After a Recording Was Done</h2><p>Now we know how to get rid of noise before a Skype video call, but what about the video that has already been recorded? How is it possible to remove the background noise and improve the voice quality?</p><p>Well don’t worry, the quality of these ‘already recorded videos’ can be improved by using applications like Filmora. There are a variety of applications that can do this function but we prefer Filmora because of its easy to use interface and amazing results.</p><p>So here we are going to show you how to remove background noise after a recording was already done by using its Denoise feature.</p><ol><li>Download Wondershare Filmora below and open it on your computer</li></ol><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><ol><li>Go to <strong>File</strong>-<strong>I</strong> <strong>m</strong> <strong>port</strong> <strong>Media</strong> to import the recorded file to the Media Library</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-media8.jpg"                      alt="import-media8"                ></p><ol><li>Add or drag and drop the recorded file to the timeline.

If you were trying to find a way to record live TV shows from a computer, you’ve come to the right place, because in this article we will take you through all the steps you need to take in order to start recording TV shows on your PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="Pay-Attention-to-Copyright"><a href="#Pay-Attention-to-Copyright" class="headerlink" title="Pay Attention to Copyright"></a>Pay Attention to Copyright</h2><p>Supporting piracy is illegal, we don’t support it and we have no desire to promote it in this article.

You will still need the proper hardware and software in order to be able to connect your TV, Tivo game console, or any other source of video and your PC or laptop. Keep in mind that you’ll also need a sufficient amount of data storage space if you want to record entire movies or TV shows from your PC. OK, let’s dive into what you will need to record a TV show from your PC right now.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4537547&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/vcfpro.png"                      border="0"                >Video Converter Factory Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-HD-PVR-or-Capture-Card"><a href="#1-HD-PVR-or-Capture-Card" class="headerlink" title="1. HD-PVR or Capture Card"></a>1. HD-PVR or Capture Card</h3><p>These two components are the essential part of the setup you’ll need to record live TV on your PC. Although they basically do the same thing, which is to enable you to transfer the video or TV signal to the computer you are using to record the footage, there are some considerable differences between these two devices. To help you understand it, we have made a detailed explanation below based on our research. So you can choose the Capture Card or HD-PVR based on your situation correctly.</p><h4 id="Capture-Card"><a href="#Capture-Card" class="headerlink" title="Capture Card"></a>Capture Card</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capture-card-recording-tv.jpg"                      alt="Record TV with Capture Card"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>A capture card is a great choice for all PC users who don’t care too much about the quality of the footage they are recording. The device needs to be connected to a TV or a gaming console with component cables, while a free USB slot is needed in order to connect a capture card to your computer.</p><p>The price of capture cards usually varies from $50 for entry-level options to $150 for high-end devices, which makes it more affordable than its alternative, the HD-PVR. Capture cards often come equipped with its own video recording software. However, some of them don’t offer a video recording software capable of high performances, and for that reason, you must do a thorough research before you decide which capture card you want to buy.

The average price of an HD-PVR is approximately $200, even though high-end models can be even more expensive.</p><p>Most HD-PVR models feature their own video recording software, so you won’t have to spend additional money on the software you need to record a TV show from on a PC. Even if you don’t have an HD-PVR with its own built-in video recording software, obtaining a program that will enable you to record videos from a PC shouldn’t be too hard to find.</p><h3 id="2-Component-Cables"><a href="#2-Component-Cables" class="headerlink" title="2. Component Cables"></a>2. Component Cables</h3><p>The trouble with component cables is that they often must be purchased separately since most HD-PVR or capture cards manufacturers don’t include all the cables users need to connect a device to a TV and a computer. In most cases, you’ll just need a set of RCA cables, with ordinary red, yellow and white plugs to connect the capture card or an HD-PVR device to a TV. A simple USB cable can be used to establish a connection between a PC and the device you intend to use to record a TV show or any other TV-based video content.</p><h3 id="3-Video-Recording-Software"><a href="#3-Video-Recording-Software" class="headerlink" title="3. Video Recording Software"></a>3. Video Recording Software</h3><p>You don’t have to worry if you were unlucky enough to get a capture card or HD-PVR that doesn’t have a built-in video recording software because the video recording software you can use to record TV shows from a PC are fairly common and easy to come by. Furthermore, all recent versions of the Windows OS, up until Windows 7 also provide ways to record live TV.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-tv-with-windows-media-center.jpg"                      alt="Record TV with Windows Media Center"                ></p><p>The Windows Media Center is the key entertainment feature on Windows 7 that enables its users to record TV shows, schedule recording sessions and watch the recorded videos from desktop and laptop computers. However, the Windows Media Center is not on the list of built-in features on Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, but the software can be easily purchased and downloaded from the Microsoft’s website.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/game-dvr-xbox.jpg"                      alt="Windows 10 Game DVR to Record TV"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4709458&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://3d-kstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Project-Manager-3D-Models-4-800x800.jpg"                      border="0"                >Project Manager - Asset Browser for 3Ds Max</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>PC owners that have Windows 10 installed on their computers are probably better off using software like Xbox Game DVR, simply because downloading the Windows Media Center may prevent them from getting the system updates in the future. Please note that if you would like to record TV shows to DVDs, using the video recording software that enables you to record live TV from a computer may not be enough since you will need a DVD recording software as well as a PC that has a DVD burner.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Check out more Free Screen Recorders on Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you are finding a powerful software which allows to record and edit your video footage, we recommend you try <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tokenmetrics.sjv.io/c/5597632/1864921/20702" target="_top" id="1864921"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1864921"                      border="0" alt="" width="1251" height="1042"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>With Filmora, you can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record the screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the webcam, audio, and voiceover together in customizable video quality in FastJPG.

It works well with all major operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and Mac. It sets no limit on the duration of your films, which makes it great for hours-long recordings and video broadcasts. It can interact with video conferencing apps like Zoom smoothly, enabling you to enhance its usefulness and capabilities. All these capabilities of OBS Studio unarguably make it a helpful tool for video conferencing.</p><p>Open Broadcaster Software Studio is mostly used by video broadcasters to live stream videos and events. However, it may also be a terrific video conferencing tool that lets you manage what’s on the screen. Today, many companies’ professionals utilize Zoom for organizing video meetings and exploring methods to improve their visual experience. If you are a Zoom user and seeking a means to make your video calls pixel-perfect, there is good news for you. The adaptability of OBS Studio answers your demands and enables you to link Zoom with OBS Studio.</p><p>Part 1. <a href="#part1">Use Roblox Built-In Game Recorder</a></p><p>Part 2. <a href="#part2">Record Roblox Games with Filmora</a></p><p>Part 3. <a href="#part3">Record Roblox with Windows Game Bar</a></p><h5 id="Filmora-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#Filmora-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Screen Recorder"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h5><p>Record screen on PC and Mac with webcam</p><p>Capture system amd micorphone audio simultaneously</p><p>Edit video and audio with built-in tools</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Connect OBS to Zoom"></a>Part 1. How to Connect OBS to Zoom</h2><p>Zoom is one of the most popular video conferencing programs. The greatest thing is that you can live broadcast on Zoom using OBS Studio and even record your Zoom sessions using OBS Studio. OBS is recognized for its enormous community and support for hundreds of third-party plugins. As OBS is an open-source tool, you can expect it to readily connect up with dozens of other software programs, including video conferencing apps such as Zoom. To get things started, the pre-requisites are the newest version of OBS Studio, Zoom, and one of the numerous plugins that offer a virtual camera. The approach outputs OBS Studio as a virtual camera and identifies it as a video source for Zoom.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom"><a href="#Steps-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom"></a>Steps to Connect OBS to Zoom</h3><p>**<strong>Configure OBS Studio:</strong></p><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch OBS Studio and Select and download the relevant plugin depending on your operating system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configure-obs-studio.jpg"                      alt="configure obs studio"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the Tools menu. Find and click on the plugin you have downloaded and follow the vizard to replicate OBS output as a virtual camera.</p><p>**<strong>Configure Zoom:</strong></p><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> In Zoom, begin a meeting, then pick a video source. The new option introduced by your OBS plugin will display. Select it and then click on the Start Video option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configure-zoom.jpg"                      alt="configure zoom"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 2:</strong> The Zoom’s video will now accept the input from the virtual camera, which is the output provided by OBS Studio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/accept-the-input.jpg"                      alt="accept the input"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> Most of you will be on a mobile device and mobile device displays are of a different aspect ratio than your PC.

How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Part 2. How to Live Stream on Zoom with OBS</h2><p>To link the applications, we will have to establish a virtual camera utilized by Zoom as its input. The output of the virtual camera is OBS Studio. One of Zoom’s most popular features is its native video recording. Zoom users may record meetings to either their PC or to the Zoom cloud. You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio. While Zoom is acceptable as a live meeting platform, the things you can accomplish with OBS greatly offset the price of setting up the system. Play around with the parameters to achieve the results that work best for you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.devart.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=5023555&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/45b430710ad04765a6afd58d9d9fafca/products/dotConnect_O.png"                      border="0"                >dotConnect for Oracle is an ADO.NET data provider for Oracle with Entity Framework Support.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS"><a href="#Steps-to-live-stream-on-Zoom-with-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS"></a>Steps to live-stream on Zoom with OBS</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Start your Zoom meeting and OBS concurrently and have all guests joined.

How to Record Zoom Meetings with OBS</h2><p>You may use the handles to morph the preview and fit it to the screen, or press alt and drag the red handles to crop the preview for one user. Once you clip the preview for one person, you may repeat the above to process to upload the same window capture again into OBS Source and crop out to obtain each other users as well. If you want to record Zoom meetings and preserve them for later, you may obtain amazing results without any third-party software. The only things you’ll need to install are OBS and Zoom The video will have a brief time when Zoom is not in full-screen, and the cascading preview will appear if the OBS is on the same display. You may delete it in post-editing if required. The sound in the recording will be doubled if you’re using speakers since your mic will take up the output sound from your device. Use headphones to prevent this.

You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings.

Name the capture anything you wish, then click “OK.” You may use the name of the monitor you’re using for Zoom to keep things simple.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/window-capture.jpg"                      alt="window capture"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> In OBS, click on “+” under “Sources” again, then pick “Audio Input Capture.” Rename the capture source if you wish to keep it distinct from the other source and prevent misunderstanding, then hit “OK.” Press “Start Recording.” Maximize Zoom to full-screen mode to make it the only visible application on display.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-input-capture.jpg"                      alt="audio input capture"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1567905/13846" target="_top" id="1567905"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1567905"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1567905/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4718730&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/ce9a6fb2becc2d235e62b125e9260102/products/copy_vMixCallScreenshot1-large.jpg"                      border="0"                >vMix HD - Software based live production. vMix HD includes everything in vMix Basic HD plus 1000 inputs, Video List, 4 Overlay Channels, and 1 vMix Call<br>This bundle includes Studio 200 for vMix from Virtualsetworks, HTTP Matrix 1.0 automation scheduler, and 4 introductory training videos from the Udemy vMix Basic to Amazing course. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>OBS enables recording into several video formats. But the major reason why you may want to learn how to record Zoom meetings using OBS is that the software may help firms gain a step ahead on their video production. OBS is the software of choice for many, if not most, of today’s internet broadcasters. This free program allows you to create “scenes,” utilizing your camera feed together with any other movies or photos you wish to incorporate. The outcome is subsequently streamed live to your streaming platforms of choice, such as YouTube or Twitch, and&#x2F;or to a recorder.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"
