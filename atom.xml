However, there are certain OBS issues that are often reported on different forums. OBS Studio not recording full screen is a common complaint. There are many who have reported that OBS is capturing Windowed screen but as soon as they are switching to Full screen recording, OBS fails miserably and captures only a black screen instead. There could be various reasons behind OBS full screen not working.</p><p>First of all, OBS Studio files could have got corrupted somehow. Sometimes, OBS Studio is heavily using CPU resources in capturing full screen, and hence, due to very fast access, CPU has limited the access of usage. There are could be a compatibility issue with OBS Studio and your Windows version. Sometimes, any third-party screen recording software could intervene in OBS operation. In this article, we will illustrate all the possible ways to fix OBS does not recording full screen issue.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/748964/4704" target="_top" id="748964"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-748964"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/748964/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Way-1-Modify-CPU-Setting-for-OBS"><a href="#Way-1-Modify-CPU-Setting-for-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Modify CPU Setting for OBS"></a>Way 1. Modify CPU Setting for OBS</h2><p>By default, OBS CPU usage present is set to very fast. This means the encoder is running very fast which leads to less CPU time usage. The higher the present, the less is the CPU usage. Unless you have a high-end computer, this default setting can lead to rendering and encoding issues. OBS uses more CPU resources when you are recording full screen. CPU tends to limit its allocation for OBS when OBS starts using CPU resources at a very fast speed. This leads to OBS not full screen recording issue. You should change the setting by taking the following steps.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS Studio and go to Controls tab.</p><p>Step 2: Click on Settings button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-click-on-settings-button.jpg"                      alt="obs click on settings button"                ></p><p>Step 3: Go to Output tab and change Output Mode from Simple to Advanced.</p><p>Step 4: Change CPU Usage Present from Veryfast to Ultrafast so that OBS uses less CPU resources for the encoding process.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3922934&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/4b0a0290ad7df100b77e86839989a75e/products/ripperpro.png"                      border="0"                >WonderFox DVD Ripper Pro</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-change-cpu-usage.jpg"                      alt="obs change cpu usage"                ></p><p>Step 5: Click on Apply and Ok button.</p><h2 id="Way-2-Shut-Down-The-Game-Bar-Recording"><a href="#Way-2-Shut-Down-The-Game-Bar-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Shut Down The Game Bar Recording"></a>Way 2. Shut Down The Game Bar Recording</h2><p>There are certain gaming features available in Windows 10 that cause rendering issue for OBS studio. If game mode is on, all the GPU resources are used in the active game and hence, OBS suffers in performance. Similarly, if Game Bar recording is on, it interferes with OBS Studio full screen recording and leads to OBS studio not recording full screen game. You need to turn off Game Bar recording by taking the following steps.</p><p>Step 1: Go to Start menu and open Settings app.</p><p>Step 2: From Setting, open Gaming option.</p><p>Step 3: Go to Xbox Game Bar tab on the left side.</p><p>4: Turn it off so that it does not record your gameplay.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-settings-xbox-game-bar.jpg"                      alt="windows settings xbox game bar"                ></p><h2 id="Way-3-Empower-the-Compatibility-Mode"><a href="#Way-3-Empower-the-Compatibility-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Way 3. Empower the Compatibility Mode"></a>Way 3. Empower the Compatibility Mode</h2><p>One of the common reasons why OBS does not recording full screen is due to compatibility issue with the operating system. That is why there is an option available in Windows to run any application in compatible mode with lower Windows version. You can do the same for OBS Studio and there are many users who have reported the issue of full screen recording getting solved when they changed the compatibility mode to Windows 8. Here are the steps you have to take.</p><p>Step 1: Launch OBS Studio on your computer.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Start menu and open Task Manager.</p><p>Step 3: On Task manager, find OBS Studio under Apps. Right-click on it and select Properties.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-task-manager-properties.jpg"                      alt="windows task manager properties"                ></p><p>Step 4: From Properties, copy the file location.

Turn Your Gameplay to Windowed Mode</h2><p>When OBS Studio not recording full screen game, you have to move to Windowed Mode momentarily to ensure OBS Studio is actually capturing the gameplay or not.

However, not many have the necessary features for high-quality screen recording. Here are the main features that make a good online recorder.</p><p>Good Video Quality: A good screen recorder should let you record at the present screen resolution. Therefore, if you have a 4K monitor, you should be able to record the screen at 4K resolution. However, a minimum HD resolution is a must. A good screen recorder offers Full HD recording, while some offer 2K and 4K recording.</p><p>Capture Audio and Webcam: A good online video recorder lets you record your screen and your webcam with audio. This is useful when you want to record your screen, show your face, and give your commentary. Besides, you can also record your screen with internal audio or mic audio without a webcam. Therefore, go for a screen recorder with audio online and webcam capture.</p><p>User-Friendly Interface - The overall interface of the online screen recorder for PC has to be intuitive and user-friendly. This means you should be able to record with a minimum number of steps. Besides, customizing the settings should be easy, and the download option should be readily available. In addition, some screen recorders come with a basic video editor, which is an add-on.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4596923&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_468X60.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Online-Screen-Recorders"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Online-Screen-Recorders" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Shooting the messenger isn’t a good idea.</p><p>Without further ado, here are the 7 best Fps games available right now.</p><h3 id="1-BLACK-MESA"><a href="#1-BLACK-MESA" class="headerlink" title="1.BLACK MESA"></a>1.BLACK MESA</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/black-mesa-poster.jpg"                      alt="black-mesa-poster"                ></p><p>Black Mesa is just a fan-made Half-Life 1 remake that runs on the latest Source engine.

For each ammunition type, you may change barrels, mounts, scopes, flashlights, foregrips, pistol grips, handguards, muzzle attachments, stocks, charging handles, magazines, receivers, and gas blocks as well as select from a variety of cartridge kinds.

Most Mac users never have the need to change this setting, because they can always move the file to a folder where they want to store it. On the other hand, creating a lot of screenshots every day can make a chaos on your desktop. Luckily changing the destination where your screenshots are saved is a simple process that lets you decide where your images will be stored.</p><p>Here’s how you can change the location where the screenshots you take using the keyboard shortcuts will be saved.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://thefitville.pxf.io/c/5597632/1526796/15852" target="_top" id="1526796"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1526796"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1526796/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.mirillis.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4704640&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/547a5a56d43f6d40f9a6a2f76501d013/products/1_mirillis_action_boxshot_store_1x.jpg"                      border="0"                ><br>    Home Use license is dedicated for personal, non-commercial use only.<br>    If Action! is used for commercial gain or to further any commercial purpose,<br>    a Commercial Use license is required.

Do not delete the new folder, because your Mac may not be able to take screenshots, afterward. The process described below is the only way you can delete a folder or add a new destination for your screenshots, and failing to comply with it may cause your Mac to malfunction.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.abbyy.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39254549&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/0e5fb5c76fca16adbee503c9aff393cd/products/8_FR-Badges-NEW-FR-Standard-16-WIN-200.png"                      border="0"                > PDF application, powered by AI-based OCR, for unified workflows with both digital and scanned documents. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mac-screenshot-terminal.jpg"                      alt=" Mac Screenshots"                ></p><p>Create a new folder on the desired location on your hard drive, and then launch Terminal, by typing Terminal in the Search Box and clicking on its icon. Once the app is open, you should insert the following command into the Terminal window:</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screencapture location</strong></p><p>Then enter a space at the end after ‘location’.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4712430&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c404a5adbf90e09631678b13b05d9d7a/products/dlnow_256.png"                      border="0"                >DLNow Video Downloader</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mac-screenshot-terminal-settings.jpg"                      alt=" Mac Screenshots"                ></p><p>The next step is to add the new location at which screenshots will be saved and you can do this by simply dragging the folder you created into Terminal and adding it at the end of the command you just entered. A path is created and the command line should now contain the folder’s unique location and it should look like this:</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screencapture location &#x2F;Users&#x2F;username&#x2F;Screenshots</strong></p><p>To execute the command you have to press Enter. After Terminal finishes running the command, its window will appear on the screen again. You should proceed to confirm the changes you’ve just made by resetting the User Interface on your computer. In order to do so, you’ll have to insert this command below the one you previously entered：</p><p><strong>killall SystemUIServer</strong></p><p>Hit Enter once more to confirm the changes and run the new command. Close Terminal app by clicking on the Terminal menu and selecting the Quick Terminal option. The default location where the screenshots are saved on your Mac is now changed and every time you take a screenshot using the Command + Shift + 3 shortcut the file will be saved at the new location. If for whatever reason you want to make the Desktop once again the destination where the screenshots on your computer will be saved here’s how you can do it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1572622/13846" target="_top" id="1572622"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1572622"                      border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1298"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1572622/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-the-Screenshot-Save-Location-Back-to-Desktop"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-the-Screenshot-Save-Location-Back-to-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change the Screenshot Save Location Back to Desktop"></a>Part 2: How to Change the Screenshot Save Location Back to Desktop</h2><p>The process of changing the default screenshot save location back to Desktop is nearly identical to the process we just described. You just have to open the Terminal app and insert the following command into the prompt.</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screen capture location &#x2F;Users&#x2F;Username&#x2F;Desktop&#x2F;</strong></p><p>Make sure that your username is properly written, and then press Enter to run the command. Now you only have to reset the UI so it can recognize the changes you’ve made, and you can do it by inserting the <strong>killall SystemUIServer</strong> command into the Terminal window and pressing Enter to execute it.</p><p>Don’t forget that deleting the folder you use as a default location for storing screenshots should only be done using the process we just described in the Terminal application, since all other methods may cause unnecessary trouble.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

The good thing is, while using a desktop version, you can allow participants to share their whiteboard. You can also allow or prohibit them from annotating on the whiteboard that share. About the mobile versions, Zoom is available for both Android and iOS platforms. However, the latter variant of the app can be installed only on iPad. All in all, Zoom is available for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS devices where all the variants of the program share almost identical interface and therefore can be used seamlessly throughout.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

So, the technology is continuously evolving to give the participants the best video-conferencing experience. Grid view is one of the features that video-conferencing applications provide to their users to see all participants.</p><p>Previously, only 4 participants could be viewed in the Grid view mode. However, Google Meet has introduced a tiled layout in an update that lets you see 49 participants simultaneously on the screen. The following article will educate you about enabling grid and tiled view in Google Meet and address some other relevant concerns.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Enable-Tiled-View-in-Google-Meet-to-See-Everyone-on-Desktop"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Enable-Tiled-View-in-Google-Meet-to-See-Everyone-on-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Enable Tiled View in Google Meet to See Everyone on Desktop?"></a>Part 1: How to Enable Tiled View in Google Meet to See Everyone on Desktop?</h2><p>The tiled view is one of the preferred layout options in Google Meet. Tiled view in Google Meet expanded the range of visible participants. So, if you have joined a video conference room of many participants, Google Meet tiled layout can help you view all participants simultaneously.</p><p>Moreover, when the speaker switches among participants, the screen does not change when the tiled mode is enabled. Do you want to learn how to enable tiled view in Google Meet on desktop? If yes, follow the simple steps below.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open Google Meet and join the meeting</strong></p><p>Access the Google Meet website or launch its app. Click on the new meeting to start a video session.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: You can also join the meeting using an invitation link or entering code. This works when you are joining the session as a participant, not a host.</p><p>Step 2: Switch to tiled layout</p><p>Click on the <strong>three dots</strong> at the bottom of the screen. Select <strong>change layout</strong> from the menu and choose the <strong>tiled</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-change-layout.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet change layout"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Expand View</strong></p><p>Use a slider to increase or decrease the number of participants you want to see.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The slider can expand the view up to 49 participants.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=3851655&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://www.aiseesoft.com/avangate/30p/banner.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-tiled-view-to-view-participants.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet change enable tiled view"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Enable-Grid-View-on-Google-Meet-Mobile-Apps"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Enable-Grid-View-on-Google-Meet-Mobile-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Enable Grid View on Google Meet Mobile Apps?"></a>Part 2: How to Enable Grid View on Google Meet Mobile Apps?</h2><p>Google Meet apps don’t support the change layout option. Thus, there are two approaches to enable the Grid view when participating in a Google Meet session through mobile phone. The following section will explain both methods in a simple step-by-step process.

Google Meet Grid View extension has proved to be a blessing for meeting hosts and participants of the Google Meet session. However, many Google Meet users have reported issues with the working of Google Meet Grid View recently. We have a quick fix for you if you encounter issues while using or enabling the Grid View. Let’s follow the step-by-step guide below.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Download the latest version of Grid View.</strong></p><p>Install 1.31 or newer version of Grid view by clicking on the <a class="link"   href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-meet-grid-view/kklailfgofogmmdlhgmjgenehkjoioip?hl=en" >extension link <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and tap <strong>add to chrome</strong> option.

Choose <strong>more tools</strong> from the list. Select Extensions from the list of options in the more tools and turn on the developer mode at the top right of the corner.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Also, check whether the extension is installed or not. If it is available, try re-installing it. If it is still not visible, update Google chrome.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-grid-view-extension-developer-mode.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet view all extension enable "                ></p><p><strong>Step 3 : Check the working in Google Meet</strong></p><p>Click <strong>new meeting</strong> in the Google Meet. <strong>Tap enable grid view</strong> when you want to see all participants in the meeting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-google-meet-grid-view-troubleshooting.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet view all extension enable "                ></p><h3 id="Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-See-Everyone-on-Google-Meet"><a href="#Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-See-Everyone-on-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="Frequently Asked Questions About See Everyone on Google Meet"></a>Frequently Asked Questions About See Everyone on Google Meet</h3><h4 id="1-How-do-I-see-everyone-on-Google-Meet-mobile"><a href="#1-How-do-I-see-everyone-on-Google-Meet-mobile" class="headerlink" title="1. How do I see everyone on Google Meet mobile?"></a>1. How do I see everyone on Google Meet mobile?</h4><p>Google Meet does not allow to view more than 4 participants simultaneously on iOS and Android Devices. However, if it is crucial for you to monitor the activity of all participants, it is better to use the browser on the phone rather than the application. It is better to enable desktop mode before joining the Google Meeting session on the phone’s browser. And the most people that you can see in the screen is 49 at the time of writing.</p><h4 id="2-Why-can’t-I-install-the-Grid-View-extension"><a href="#2-Why-can’t-I-install-the-Grid-View-extension" class="headerlink" title="2. Why can’t I install the Grid View extension?"></a>2. Why can’t I install the Grid View extension?</h4><p>You might not be able to download the Grid View extension for a couple of reasons. Most of the time, you have a duplicate extension installed. So, you need to delete all duplicate extensions and then re-install the Grid View extension. Another reason for encountering issues when installing an extension can be that you are not downloading it from the right developer.</p><h4 id="3-Can-you-record-a-Google-Meet-in-grid-view"><a href="#3-Can-you-record-a-Google-Meet-in-grid-view" class="headerlink" title="3. Can you record a Google Meet in grid view?"></a>3. Can you record a Google Meet in grid view?</h4><p>If you think about whether one can record a Google Meet session in Grid view, the answer is yes for the one hosting a meeting. So, the person sharing a screen and talking will be recorded, and Google Meet in-built recorder will not record all participants in the tile.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Sometimes, it becomes essential to make all participants visible in the grid. For instance, if you have been asked to invigilate students in an online test, monitoring the activity of all participants becomes your job duty. Like other conferencing apps, Google Meet offers a grid view to see participants in your window. Alongside auto, slide bar, and spotlight, Google Meet facilitates the users with the tiled view. In this article, we have gathered sufficient information on how to enable grid view in Google Meet. Not just on desktop, the article mentions configuring the layout on mobile devices as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Mastering EZ Grabber’s Functions"></a>Become an Expert in No Time! Mastering EZ Grabber’s Functions</h2><p>Are you a full-time gamer or like to rewatch some spectacular scenes from the movies or videos you see on your computer later? But are unable to record those moments separately and at that instant and later need to go back to that point of the scene to record the same. It might get a bit time-consuming and frustrating to do so. For this situation, the ideal problem solver would be installing the <strong>EZ grabber software</strong> on your computer.</p><p>The EZ grabber software is a piece of capturing equipment designed to capture MPEG that converts the images on screen into videos. You can easily record the videos on screen by clicking the rec button and connecting your device using an S-video connector or an AV. The resolution of the videos can touch the heights of 720p, which you can also edit and upload on the internet.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993650">                    <video width="720" height="300" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993650">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993650.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:720px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993650%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993650/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 1\.

This could only be done by jailbreaking the device or installing a third-party <strong>iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen recorder</strong>.</p><p>Another alternative was to connect your device to a Mac and use QuickTime to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen. This can be also troublesome as you can not carry a Mac along with you if you need to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad’s screen.</p><p>But all this has changed with the outcome of iOS 11. Apple has added a built-in mobile screen recorder. With the <strong>iPhone&#x2F;iPad built-in screen recorder</strong>, you no longer need to jailbreak your device or install third-party screen recorders.</p><p>So, in this article, we will show you how to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen whether your iOS device is running the latest iOS 11 and later versions or not.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Record Screen with Built-in Screen Recorder in iPhone&#x2F;iPad</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Use QuickTime to record iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen</a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=35038891&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.dupinout.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DupInOut-New-Duplicate-Scan-Tab.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Built-in-Screen-Recorder-in-iPhone-iPad-For-iOS-11-and-Later-Versions"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Record-Screen-with-Built-in-Screen-Recorder-in-iPhone-iPad-For-iOS-11-and-Later-Versions" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Record Screen with Built-in Screen Recorder in iPhone&#x2F;iPad [For iOS 11 and Later Versions]"></a>Part 1: How to Record Screen with Built-in Screen Recorder in iPhone&#x2F;iPad [For iOS 11 and Later Versions]</h2><p> The iOS 11 has come with a built-in mobile screen recording feature, so if you’re running the iOS 11 and later iOS versions, you can use the free recording tool of iPhone directly. This built-in app has provided a great alternative to the traditional methods to record screen videos without the use of third-party apps for iOS users. The built-in screen recorder has made the whole process very easy and simple.

In the following section, we will show you how to do it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Use-QuickTime-to-Record-Screens-of-iPhone-iPad-Version-Before-iOS-11"><a href="#Part-2-Use-QuickTime-to-Record-Screens-of-iPhone-iPad-Version-Before-iOS-11" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Use QuickTime to Record Screens of iPhone&#x2F;iPad (Version Before iOS 11)"></a>Part 2: Use <a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/quicktime" >QuickTime <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to Record Screens of iPhone&#x2F;iPad (Version Before iOS 11)</h2><p>People need to download and install a third-party iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen recorder after jailbreaking the device and going through a complicated installation process. iOS is always risky to jailbreak your device as if you don’t do it carefully your device will get broken. It means your device will stop functioning and you will need to go to Apple care for getting it fixed. Jailbreaking also voids your warranty. So rather than going through these risks, people preferred using QuickTime to record their Phone&#x2F;iPad’s screen.</p><p>With QuickTime media player you could record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad’s Screen. For recording your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen with the help of QuickTime, you would need Mac OS X. Below are the steps to record your iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen on your Mac by using QuickTime.</p><p>1. Connect your iOS device (iPhone&#x2F;iPad&#x2F;iPod touch) to your Mac with a USB cable.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4621764&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.x-mirage.com/x-mirage/img/page-home.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20logo.jpg"                      alt="quicktime"                ></p><p>2. Launch QuickTime on your Mac available in the application folder.</p><p>3. Click on the File menu on the QuickTime menu bar and choose New Movie Recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20new%20moive.jpg"                      alt="quicktime"                ></p><p>4. A video recording screen will open. Now slide the cursor over that window to make the record and volume button visible.</p><p>5. Click on the arrow next to the red record button to show the camera and microphone recording options. Choose your device from the list of devices and you will be able to see your device screen in the QuickTime window.</p><p>6. Click on the red record button when you want to start recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/quicktime%20iphone.jpg"                      alt="quicktime screen recorder"                ></p><p>7. To stop the recording of the screen of your iOS device, click on the Stop button at the video recorder window.</p><p>8. If you want to edit the video, you can do it in QuickTime (for basic editing). You can also save the recorded video first and then edit it later. You can directly save it as it is in QuickTime by going to File Menu and clicking on save option.</p><p>The recorded video will be saved in .mov file format which you can later export to view on certain devices. You can edit the video later in QuickTime, Wondershare Filmora, or others and share it online for tutorials or demonstration, and whatever you want to do with it. This method of recording the iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen is useful for devices running the iOS version lower than 11. This is a far safer method to record device screen video than jailbreaking. But with the addition of a mobile screen recorder app in iOS 11 and above, it seems a little bit clumsy by using QuickTime.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>iPhone&#x2F;iPad screen recorder is a very useful tool when you want to record tutorials, demonstrations, or report bugs. The demand for mobile screen recorders is rapidly increasing. Youngsters also love recording funny clips and videos to share the video on social media networks and other platforms.
