In addition, most of these platforms grant you access to various collaboration tools that make the participants in a meeting more productive.</p><p><strong>Screen sharing</strong> is undoubtedly one of the most useful collaboration tools video conferencing services can offer, as it allows the users to share a live feed of their computer screens with all other attendees of a web conference. This, in turn, enables the swift flow of information between all participants in a video conference and it gives them immediate insight into everything that is happening on a shared screen.</p><p>We’ve done some researches and find out some video conferencing services that offers screen sharing. In this article we are going to take you through the ten best options you can use free of charge.</p><h2 id="The-Ten-Best-Video-Conferencing-Software-That-Provide-Screen-Sharing-Options"><a href="#The-Ten-Best-Video-Conferencing-Software-That-Provide-Screen-Sharing-Options" class="headerlink" title="The Ten Best Video Conferencing Software That Provide Screen Sharing Options"></a>The Ten Best Video Conferencing Software That Provide Screen Sharing Options</h2><p>Even though each video conferencing software we included in this article can be used for free, some of the services offer only a limited set of options on their free versions. This means that the number of participants or the maximum duration of a group meeting can be restricted.</p><p>Purchasing a subscription plan is your only option if you want to be able to use all tools these video conferencing services have to offer. Here are the ten best video conferencing software products that provide screen sharing features.</p><h3 id="1-GoToMeeting"><a href="#1-GoToMeeting" class="headerlink" title="1. GoToMeeting"></a>1. GoToMeeting</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, pricing plans start at $12.00 per month</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web</p><p>There are only a handful of video conference services out there that offer more than GoToMeeting. You can use this app directly from your web-browser, on your Smartphone or Macs and PCs. The free version of GoToMeeting includes the screen sharing feature and it provides webcam support.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gotomeeting-screen-sharing.jpg"                      alt="GoToMeeting Screen Sharing options"                ></p><p>Sharing a screen with GoToMeeting is a simple process that can be completed in just a few easy steps regardless of the device you’re using. However, if you opt for the free version of this video conferencing service you won’t be able to host meetings that have more than three participants. Furthermore, the maximum duration of a group meeting is limited to just forty minutes which makes the free version of GoToMeeting a good option just for individuals and small businesses. If you want to have access to unlimited cloud recording, automatic transcription or keyboard and mouse sharing options you will have to purchase the Business or Enterprise subscription model.</p><h3 id="2-Zoom"><a href="#2-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="2. Zoom"></a>2. Zoom</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, pricing options start at $14.99 per month</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, web</p><p>In case you are looking for a video conferencing service that allows you to host meetings that have up to a hundred participants for free, then Zoom is the right choice for you. Moreover, the platform doesn’t limit the number of meetings you can host, although hosting meetings that are longer than forty minutes is not possible on the free version of Zoom.</p><p>As a host of a Zoom meeting, you can enable one or more participants to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >share screens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> simultaneously. The service also allows the host to disable this option entirely or to choose which participants can have access to this option during a meeting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-screen-to-share-on-zoom.jpg"                      alt="Share Screen on Zoom"                ></p><p>Zoom cannot display more than 25 screens within the same window, which can limit your options if you are hosting a meeting with a large number of participants. You can<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record all of your meetings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to a local hard drive if you are using the Mac or PC version of Zoom, but you must upgrade to a paid version of Zoom if you want to store your recordings on the cloud.</p><p>Want to record the Zoom meeting but no permission yet, check some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best free screen recorder for Zoom Meetings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h3 id="3-Cisco-Webex"><a href="#3-Cisco-Webex" class="headerlink" title="3. Cisco Webex"></a>3. Cisco Webex</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, pricing plans start at $14.00 per month</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, iOS, Android</p><p>Entrepreneurs who want to host meetings with up to a hundred participants for free should consider using Cisco Webex. In addition, you can use a number of devices such as the Cisco Webex Board, room or desk devices for your presentations and meetings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/webex-screen-sharing.jpg"                      alt="Share Screen on Cisco Webex"                ></p><p>Screen sharing is just one among countless options you will have at your disposal if you opt for the free version of Cisco Webex since this video conferencing service enables you to choose between different view outlines, create personal rooms or share files without any limitations. What’s more, you can host an unlimited number of meetings that can last for as long as you want, because there are no restrictions regarding the maximum duration of a meeting. The screen sharing feature is available even on the Cisco Webex mobile app so that you can share your device’s screen even if you are attending a meeting from you phone.</p><h3 id="4-Skype"><a href="#4-Skype" class="headerlink" title="4. Skype"></a>4. Skype</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, iOS, Android</p><p>Skype is probably one of the oldest applications that provides video call services to its users for nearly two decades. Besides offering video chat and messaging tools, Skype also allows you to organize conference calls with up to fifty participants. All you need to do in order to create a conference call on Skype is to generate a call link with a single click and then share the invitations with the participants who can join the call via the unique link you send to them.</p><p>Each participant in a conference call can share their screen at any point in the meeting which makes the collaboration between different team members easier. You can record all your conference calls and Skype is going to store them for an entire month before deleting them. However, Skype offers fewer options than most video conferencing services, since you can’t schedule meetings in advance, create private rooms or adjust the meeting’s settings.</p><h3 id="5-Apache-OpenMeetings"><a href="#5-Apache-OpenMeetings" class="headerlink" title="5. Apache OpenMeetings"></a>5. Apache OpenMeetings</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, Linux, Ubuntu</p><p>This open-source software is equipped with a broad range of video conferencing tools that enable you to schedule meetings, send instant messages or even edit documents. The maximum number of participants in a meeting depends on the type of meeting you select since you can create conference rooms with up to 32 participants, webinars with up to a hundred attendees or interviews that can’t include more than two persons.</p><p>It is hardly surprising that Apache OpenMeetings allows its users to share screens during video calls because the software is stacked with features that can potentially make the collaboration between team members more productive. In addition, you can record all video conferences you organize with this software, although you can only store footage on your local hard drive. Apache OpenMeetings is far from easy to use, and you are going to need some coding experience in order to optimize the software in accordance with your needs.</p><h3 id="6-Join-Me"><a href="#6-Join-Me" class="headerlink" title="6. Join.Me"></a>6. Join.Me</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, pricing plans start at $10 per month</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, iOS, Android</p><p>Even though hosting meetings on Join.Me used to be free, the company discontinued the free version of the software a little over a year ago. Currently, you can only host a meeting on Join.Me if you purchase a monthly subscription, but participants don’t have to pay a fee in order to attend a meeting.</p><p>In case you opt for the least expensive Lite subscription model you will be able to host meetings that have up to five participants, although the webcam streaming option is not going to be available. The screen and window sharing feature is available within all subscription models, which means that you can use this collaboration tool regardless of the pricing plan you choose. None of the subscription models offered by Join.Me limits the maximum number of meetings you can have in one month or their duration. However, if you want to get access to recording features or store your videos online you will have to opt for the Pro or Business subscription plan.</p><h3 id="7-Google-Hangouts"><a href="#7-Google-Hangouts" class="headerlink" title="7. Google Hangouts"></a>7. Google Hangouts</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Web-based</p><p>All you need to host a video call that has up to ten participants is a Google account and access to a web browser, and Google Hangouts is going to take care of the rest. Although Google Hangouts isn’t necessarily the first option that comes to mind when video conferencing platforms are mentioned, the app is still a reliable choice for anyone who wants to host a video meeting.</p><p>What’s more Google Hangouts is equipped with screen sharing features which makes it a perfect collaboration tool for small and medium-sized teams. The best part is that like most of Google’s apps, Google Hangouts is completely free. However, the app is not without limitations, so you shouldn’t expect to find any advanced video conferencing options offered by Zoom or GoToMeeting. Even so, Google Hangouts offers a quick solution if you want to host an online meeting without having to go through the software installation process.</p><h3 id="8-TeamViewer"><a href="#8-TeamViewer" class="headerlink" title="8. TeamViewer"></a>8. TeamViewer</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, pricing plans start at $33.00 per month</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, Android, iOS</p><p>Although TeamViewer isn’t a video conferencing software, it is one of the best options you’ll have if you want to access different devices remotely. It is commonly used by customer support teams to provide assistance to users who are experiencing difficulties with a software product, but you can also use it to transfer large files, print documents remotely or install applications on a Smartphone or a computer.</p><p>Furthermore, you can install <a class="link"   href="https://www.blizz.com/en/" >Blizz TeamViewer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to schedule meetings that have up to 300 participants, record your meetings or enable members of your team to share their screens during meetings. The platform enables you to set up a meeting with a single click, while it also offers the HD VoIP option that allows you to reach your clients and colleagues wherever they are. Even though TeamViewer and Blizz TeamViewer can be downloaded for free, you must purchase a subscription plan in order to use all of the features they have to offer.</p><h3 id="9-FreeConference"><a href="#9-FreeConference" class="headerlink" title="9. FreeConference"></a>9. FreeConference</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, pricing plans start at $9.99 per month</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS</p><p>Besides video conferencing tools, this software also offers free conference calls, you just have to pick a free dial-in number or even choose a dedicated dial-in number. Setting up a video conference is an intuitive process that won’t take more than a few moments of your time.</p><p>However, the free version of FreeConference doesn’t allow you to host meetings that have more than five participants. Each participant can share their screen easily regardless of the pricing plan you have, while they can also communicate via chat throughout the meeting. Conference calls that are not hosted over the Internet can have up to a hundred participants and you can have an unlimited number of calls if you are calling local numbers. Online whiteboard, document sharing or SMS entry are also the options you’re going to have at your disposal if you choose the free version of the FreeConference software. Keep in mind that audio and video recording options are not going to be available unless you purchase a conferencing plan.</p><h3 id="10-Lifesize-Video-Conferencing"><a href="#10-Lifesize-Video-Conferencing" class="headerlink" title="10. Lifesize Video Conferencing"></a>10. Lifesize Video Conferencing</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, pricing plans start at $16.95 per month</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, iOS, Android</p><p>Lifesize Video Conferencing is a perfect option for you if you need to host a large number of meetings for free on a monthly level because it enables you to host an unlimited number of meetings every month. The maximum number of participants is limited to 25, although you can host up to 300 participants if you purchase one of the available subscription plans.</p><p>Unlike other video conferencing services that provide HD video quality, Lifesize Video Conferencing offers support for 4K video meetings, although this option is only available within Plus and Enterprise pricing plans. Unsurprisingly, sharing a screen during a meeting is remarkably easy as you just have to click on the Present button and decide if you want to share the entire screen or just an application window. Recording a meeting is not possible with the free version of the software, while the scheduling options leave much to be desired regardless of the pricing model.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>A simple feature like screen sharing can make a world of difference for your team’s productivity, as it enables the participants in a meeting to present their ideas or collaborate on a document effortlessly. This feature is included in the free version of most video conferencing software products you can find on the market, which means that the participants of the meetings you host are going to be able to share their screens even if you don’t purchase a subscription plan.

You have the option of selecting Full Screen, Custom, or Target Window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-record-screen.jpg"                      alt="filmora screen recorder"                ></p><p>You may use the Microphone icon to pick the microphone you’ll be using to record audio, and you can use the Speakers icon to activate or mute the computer’s speakers while the screen recording session is in progress.</p><p>The Settings icon may be seen in the window’s bottom right corner; click it to access additional settings.

The file will be instantly launched in Filmora’s video editor, allowing you to make any necessary edits before publishing it online.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Record-Film-on-Mac-with-QuickTime-3"><a href="#Part-2-Record-Film-on-Mac-with-QuickTime-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Record Film on Mac with QuickTime"></a>Part 2. Record Film on Mac with QuickTime</h2><p>If you’re using an earlier version of MacOS than Mojave, you may always use QuickTime Player to record your screen (as well as audio recording). QuickTime recordings aren’t easy to edit, yet they are one of the most straightforward ways to <strong>record movie mac</strong>. QuickTime Player may be found in Catalina and Big Sur, among other places.</p><p>From the Launchpad, open QuickTime Player. Check the Launchpad’s Other folder if you don’t see it. When the app is open, go to the Menu Bar and choose File. On the drop-down menu, select New Screen Recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-screen-recording-option.jpg"                      alt="quicktime screen recording"                ></p><p>An option to allow screen recording may appear on your computer’s screen. Enter system preferences by clicking Open System Preferences. Select QuickTime Player and check the box. QuickTime Player may need to be restarted. (If you don’t, go on to the next step.) When QuickTime has restarted, go to File, then New Screen Recording.</p><p>Three buttons on the left allow you to take a screenshot, while two appear in the center to record the screen. Optional features include the ability to add or delete mouse clicks, the ability to utilize the built-in mic, and the ability to choose the video’s destination. The Record button is positioned to the right of the Record Entire Screen and Record Selected Portion buttons.</p><p>When you’re done, go to the menu bar and choose Stop Recording from the drop-down menu, as seen below.

Screen recorders are incorporated into several Android handsets. There are also hundreds of third-party screen recorder programs available for download, both free and premium. If you’re still looking for the finest <strong>android movie recorder</strong>, you may get the AZ screen recorder app right now. With its built-in technique, though, recording your iPhone’s screen is simple.</p><h3 id="For-Android-3"><a href="#For-Android-3" class="headerlink" title="For Android"></a>For Android</h3><p>AZ Screen Recorder is the most effective screen recording program I’ve discovered so far on Android, although there are many more others. It’s ad-free, doesn’t need root, has no restriction on recording time, and doesn’t apply watermarks. It’s not a terrible bargain at all. After you’ve downloaded it, go through the following steps:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/az-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="az screen recorder"                ></p><ul><li>Start the AZ Screen Recorder app by selecting it from your app drawer.</li><li>You’ll notice a four-button overlay emerge. The gear icon allows you to change the video recording parameters, including resolution, bit rate, and frame rate. Press Back to go to the home screen when you’re finished.</li><li>Start the app or browse to the screen you wish to capture and press “Record”.</li><li>AZ overlay’s AZ button has a red camera shutter icon.

You have the option of pausing or stopping the recording from the AZ notification.</li></ul><h3 id="For-iOS-3"><a href="#For-iOS-3" class="headerlink" title="For iOS"></a>For iOS</h3><p>Fortunately, if you understand how to activate it, taking a screenshot or recording a video on your iPhone’s screen is exactly as simple as before.

Look for the phrase “Screen Recording.” Tap the green + symbol next to it if it’s not already in the “Include” section. It should now appear in the “Include” column.</li><li>If you have an iPhone X or later, slide down from the top-right corner to activate the Control Center; swipe up if you have an iPhone 8 or older. The home button on an iPhone may be accessed by swiping up from the bottom of the display.</li><li>Press and hold the “Record” button. This feature is activated by pressing the Record button for three seconds, after which the button becomes red and begins recording. The time will be red in the top left corner, indicating that you’re still recording.</li><li>Press the red time indication at the upper left of the screen, then tap “Stop” to stop recording. Alternatively, you may open the Control Center and press the record button once again.</li></ul><h2 id="Wrapping-UP-3"><a href="#Wrapping-UP-3" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping UP"></a>Wrapping UP</h2><p>Recording all of your favorite movies on your Mac or PC is now easy and enjoyable.

They are also fully searchable.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>It is high on storage.</li><li>Channel limit set at 100.

They have been doing their best to provide the masses with a virtual presence for years now. Cisco meetings have all the usual audio and visual features – but they specialize in providing a secure platform from which to conduct business. This stable platform is what makes them the best video conferencing app for business, in our eyes.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>It is a very secure system, which incorporates both audio and visual meetings of high quality.</li><li>Whiteboard and screen sharing capabilities.</li><li>It works from most high-tech cars.

They have video calling down to a fine art. Second best? It is a unified communications platform that integrates with just about everything you will ever need. You can also <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >share screen on Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with others.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Maximum compatibility – laptop, tablet, iPhone, Android – Skype for Business works with everything.</li><li>It can be used with Outlook and fully integrates everything Microsoft.</li><li>Very easy to learn user interface with options for training and various helpful features.

You could, feasibly, use this service to make a pitch or presentation. It’s highly scalable, too, so it can be used across large or small businesses.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Aside from calls – you can have one-on-one while you are in a big meeting. Allows you to remind people on the fly.</li><li>It is a great conference video call app that comes with screen sharing and even remote screen contributions.</li><li>Easy to use, join, and negotiate.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Reviewers have reported poor error reporting with little fixes.</li><li>In some areas, it is too sensitive for those running meetings.</li></ul><h3 id="7-Google-Hangouts-Meet"><a href="#7-Google-Hangouts-Meet" class="headerlink" title="7.

Although it is a great video meeting app, we would opt for a specifically designed business app if we were looking for a work conference suite. On the upside, everyone has a Google account and knows how to use it. They also give unrivaled integration and quality of calls.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Fantastic clarity of audio and visual calling with loads of options for addons.</li><li>Sign in with your Google account, great integration across their range of products.</li><li>Meet with webinar-style gatherings, perfect video meeting app for students or education.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Some features are specific to G Suite customers.</li><li>Although aimed at business users, they get low reviews because it should be a social tool.</li></ul><h3 id="8-Slack"><a href="#8-Slack" class="headerlink" title="8.

It’s not that we would use it as a conference call video app, it’s more that we prefer to use it to catch up on office gossip, do daily check-ins, or give progress reports. What we’re saying is that it is an excellent in-house communications tool. We think there are better inter-office tools for making the best virtual meeting apps.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>A friendly place to chat during business hours that allows you to check on remote workers.</li><li>There is a certain amount of personalization between workers accounts.</li><li>Think of it as a virtual workplace like an office space in the virtual world. It’s less about the video calling and more about being able to check in with your colleagues.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Intended for those that need a central location to work from, which is both good and bad.</li><li>We wouldn’t use Slack for a friend group – but again, this is good and bad.</li></ul><h2 id="The-Key-Takeaways"><a href="#The-Key-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="The Key Takeaways"></a>The Key Takeaways</h2><p>Most of the best video conferencing apps are designed for both business and social use. However, most of them are better at one or the other. The best conferencing app for you will depend entirely on your needs as an individual, but it is probably on our list!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-visionary-6-eco-friendly-minecraft-mansions-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Visionary 6 Eco-Friendly Minecraft Mansions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/initial-cinematic-recording-dissection/"><u>Initial Cinematic Recording Dissection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-splitstream-analysis-top-video-camera-champion-in-2024/"><u>[New] SplitStream Analysis  Top Video Camera Champion, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/high-quality-fullscreen-recorders-for-desktops/"><u>High-Quality Fullscreen Recorders for Desktops</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-streamlining-the-process-of-ppt-recording/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Streamlining the Process of PPT Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-capturing-and-polishing-videography-in-adobe-connect-for-2024/"><u>[New] Capturing and Polishing Videography in Adobe Connect for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-advanced-facecam-recording-techniques-unveiled/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Advanced Facecam Recording Techniques Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/vidmas-screen-recorder-an-in-depth-review/"><u>Vidma’s Screen Recorder  An In-Depth Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-screen-recording-showdown-go-with-obs-studio-or-bandicam/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Screen Recording Showdown  Go with OBS Studio or Bandicam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-youtube-video-submission-your-detailed-walkthrough/"><u>2024 Approved  Mastering YouTube Video Submission  Your Detailed Walkthrough</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-learn-how-to-use-3d-camera-tracking-in-adobe-after-effects-and-take-your-skills-to-the-next-level/"><u>New 2024 Approved Learn How to Use 3D Camera Tracking in Adobe After Effects and Take Your Skills to the Next Level</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-frame-by-frame-mastery-in-youtube-no-cost-required-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Frame by Frame Mastery in YouTube - No Cost Required for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-apple-id-password-on-your-iphone-14-pro-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Change Your Apple ID Password On your iPhone 14 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-corrupt-video-files-of-tecno-using-video-repair-utility-on-mac-by-stellar-video-repair-mobile-video-repair/"><u>How to Fix corrupt video files of Tecno using Video Repair Utility on Mac?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/top-auditory-alteration-aids-for-streamers-and-clips/"><u>Top Auditory Alteration Aids for Streamers and Clips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unleash-your-potential-with-instagram-tv-upload/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Unleash Your Potential with Instagram TV Upload</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-customizing-video-assets-for-instagram-mastery/"><u>In 2024, Customizing Video Assets for Instagram Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-cant-take-screenshot-due-to-security-policy-on-xiaomi-14-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Fix Cant Take Screenshot Due to Security Policy on Xiaomi 14 Ultra | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-funny-fortunes-leading-laughs-in-the-tiktok-world/"><u>2024 Approved  Funny Fortunes  Leading Laughs in the TikTok World</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Record Webinar on Mac"></a>Part 2. Record Webinar on Mac</h2><p>Things get easy for you if you are a Mac user. You can record any webinar on your Mac without installing any external application.

How to Record Webinar on iPhone"></a>Part 3. How to Record Webinar on iPhone</h2><p>If you are attending any webinar from your iPhone, you can go for free record webinar without installing any third-party app. This is because iOS 11 and above comes with a built-in screen recorder through which you can record anything on your iPhone screen. You can find the screen recorder on the Control Center. If it is not available, you have to go to Settings&gt; Control Center &gt; Screen Recording and turn on the screen recorder option.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Unearthing-Excellent-Seeds-The-Valheim-Way"><a href="#Unearthing-Excellent-Seeds-The-Valheim-Way" class="headerlink" title="Unearthing Excellent Seeds: The Valheim Way"></a>Unearthing Excellent Seeds: The Valheim Way</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-poster.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-poster"                ></p><p>Before we delve into Valheim seeds and essential things to note, it is vital to understand the Valheim game first. Understand that, Valheim is a highly prominent Norse-themed game that is filled with monsters. However, the Valheim seeds are vital for everybody, including the hermits and the speedrunners. More so, Valheim is regarded as a Viking survival simulator. As a player of Valheim, you will be dropped in a mythological Norse world with nothing but your clothes and a request from the mighty Odin. The request states that you should conquer all the forsaken monstrous beasts roaming the lands. Though it seems easy, it gets tricky as you begin to explore the tenth Norse world. As you explore, you will notice that your food resources are getting scarce. While you may be thinking of how to get food, you can grow some crops. In Valheim, you can turn almost all areas into farmlands. Before you delve into planting Valheim seeds, you will need to choose the world you want to begin your adventure. Note that you will be exploring various biomes to get materials and food to survive. The aim is to be the best Viking in this purgatory-looking world.</p><p>This is done easily as the Valheim game will ask players to input their Valheim world seeds or leave the game to select anyone for them. The seeds are a series of numbers and letters. And, they build a generated world that comes with biomes, resources, and, not to forget, enemies.</p><h2 id="The-Best-Valheim-Seeds"><a href="#The-Best-Valheim-Seeds" class="headerlink" title="The Best Valheim Seeds"></a><strong>The Best Valheim Seeds</strong></h2><p>Since each seed will create a different world from the other worlds, you must check our list to find the best Valheim seeds for mining or speedrunners.</p><p> <em>“Note: The seed you select should be in direct line with your preferences in the game. ”</em></p><p>The Valheim players can use their world seeds to enter a world that has well-known challenges and layouts. Every world in this game gets a unique seed code for players to move around quickly. With the seed codes, players can keep notes of every saved world that they create.</p><p>Some of the best Valheim seeds include:</p><h3 id="1-Seed-htsE7kJL5K"><a href="#1-Seed-htsE7kJL5K" class="headerlink" title="1.Seed: htsE7kJL5K"></a>1.Seed: htsE7kJL5K</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-1.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-1"                ></p><p>Since you may want your private Island far away from everything you know, this seed is the ideal one to plant. Aside from trying to get far away, the biomes in Valheim are filled with horrible creatures that can appear at your base whenever they like and destroy everything.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is the seed you know for those who want a piece of land free from any monstrous atrocities. You will spawn it on a small island in the middle of the sea. And, the nearest boss here is Eikthyr. With such a seed, your inner Viking can be aligned with you to build a ship and sail further with plans on discovering newer lands.</p><h3 id="2-Seed-HHcLC5acQt"><a href="#2-Seed-HHcLC5acQt" class="headerlink" title="2.Seed: HHcLC5acQt"></a>2.Seed: HHcLC5acQt</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-2.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-2"                ></p><p>It is regarded as the ideal seed for the speedrunners in Valheim. Players in this world seed can spawn within a starter island with roughly four runes, close by traders and nearby bosses. The biomes here are in a distinct starter continent, plus the fifth boss can be likened to be as close as a raft that skips away. This seed is the perfect realm for the players that want to speedrun their game. While this world comes with four bosses, Haldor is on the Island as well. More so, players will find the fifth boss on a neighboring island.</p><h3 id="3-Seed-0V5BZHkqY4"><a href="#3-Seed-0V5BZHkqY4" class="headerlink" title="3.Seed: 0V5BZHkqY4"></a>3.Seed: 0V5BZHkqY4</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-3.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-3"                ></p><p>Even if you think that you are the best in Valheim, you will need to learn how to build a ship to sail and discover materials and biomes. If you never knew, sailing does have a learning curve. First of all, you will need to get the necessary ingredients to make a vessel; then, the next thing is to learn the difference between the three boat types available and how to use the wind on your side.</p><p> <em>“Note: the boat types are Karve, longship, and raft. ”</em></p><p>While in the water, it is advisable to look out for horrifying serpents that dwell in the ocean. Though some players do not want to bother themselves with sailing, the ideal seed for you will be oV5BZHkqY4.</p><h3 id="4-Seed-maypoleplz"><a href="#4-Seed-maypoleplz" class="headerlink" title="4.Seed: maypoleplz"></a>4.Seed: maypoleplz</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-4.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-4"                ></p><p>In such a game that concentrates on surviving and crafting, all the help you need will be gotten. To help the amateur players, developers of Valheim added a unique yet rare structure to the game.</p><p>This structure is known as Maypole.

Understand that, Valheim is a highly prominent Norse-themed game that is filled with monsters. However, the Valheim seeds are vital for everybody, including the hermits and the speedrunners. More so, Valheim is regarded as a Viking survival simulator. As a player of Valheim, you will be dropped in a mythological Norse world with nothing but your clothes and a request from the mighty Odin. The request states that you should conquer all the forsaken monstrous beasts roaming the lands. Though it seems easy, it gets tricky as you begin to explore the tenth Norse world. As you explore, you will notice that your food resources are getting scarce. While you may be thinking of how to get food, you can grow some crops. In Valheim, you can turn almost all areas into farmlands. Before you delve into planting Valheim seeds, you will need to choose the world you want to begin your adventure. Note that you will be exploring various biomes to get materials and food to survive. The aim is to be the best Viking in this purgatory-looking world.</p><p>This is done easily as the Valheim game will ask players to input their Valheim world seeds or leave the game to select anyone for them. The seeds are a series of numbers and letters. And, they build a generated world that comes with biomes, resources, and, not to forget, enemies.</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-behind-the-curtain-exclusive-review-of-apeaksofts-tech-advancements/"><u>[New] In 2024, Behind the Curtain  Exclusive Review of Apeaksoft's Tech Advancements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-freeze-frame-fun-the-complete-guide-to-xbox-one-snapshots/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Freeze Frame Fun  The Complete Guide to Xbox One Snapshots</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/navigating-the-best-webinars-for-business/"><u>Navigating the Best Webinars for Business</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-best-mac-visual-snapshot-list-limit-156-chars/"><u>2024 Approved  Best Mac Visual Snapshot List (Limit  156 Chars)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-simple-strategies-for-capturing-games-on-consoles/"><u>[New] In 2024, Simple Strategies for Capturing Games on Consoles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-ultimate-guide-to-non-udemy-online-education-sites/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Ultimate Guide to Non-Udemy Online Education Sites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-obs-vs-shadowplay-which-to-choose-for-2024/"><u>[New] OBS vs ShadowPlay - Which to Choose for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-advanced-screen-recording-methods-on-dell-laptops/"><u>[New] Advanced Screen Recording Methods on Dell Laptops</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/expert-tips-for-safaris-picture-and-window-sharing-feature-for-2024/"><u>Expert Tips for Safari's Picture and Window Sharing Feature for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-crafting-visual-wonders-an-insiders-guide-to-editing-on-snapchat/"><u>In 2024, Crafting Visual Wonders  An Insider’s Guide to Editing on Snapchat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/restore-missing-app-icon-on-realme-note-50-step-by-step-solutions-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Restore Missing App Icon on Realme Note 50 Step-by-Step Solutions | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/synthesizing-authenticity-two-paths-to-cloning-human-like-ai-vocalizations/"><u>Synthesizing Authenticity Two Paths to Cloning Human-Like AI Vocalizations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-effortless-device-integration-with-obs-for-streaming-on-pcmac/"><u>2024 Approved  Effortless Device Integration with OBS for Streaming on PC/Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/updated-subtitle-your-videos-for-free-top-10-online-makers-for-2024/"><u>Updated Subtitle Your Videos for Free Top 10 Online Makers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-whatsapp-status-video-creation-tools/"><u>New 2024 Approved WhatsApp Status Video Creation Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-use-allshare-cast-to-turn-on-screen-mirroring-on-huawei-nova-y71-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Use Allshare Cast To Turn On Screen Mirroring On Huawei Nova Y71 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-do-you-know-capcut-has-some-amazing-slow-motion-templates-you-can-utilize-read-this-article-to-access-the-slow-motion-capcut-templates/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Do You Know CapCut Has some Amazing Slow-Motion Templates You Can Utilize?

However, the built-in Screen Recorder on Huawei’s Mate 10, 20 P20 or P10 Android devices doesn’t allow you to specify the region of the screen you want to capture or select the frame rate, so if you want to gain access to more powerful screen recording tools you should install an app such as AZ Screen Recorder or DU Recorder from the Google Play Store, but you can also record the screen on the computer with some desktop screen recorders.

In addition, most of these platforms grant you access to various collaboration tools that make the participants in a meeting more productive.</p><p><strong>Screen sharing</strong> is undoubtedly one of the most useful collaboration tools video conferencing services can offer, as it allows the users to share a live feed of their computer screens with all other attendees of a web conference. This, in turn, enables the swift flow of information between all participants in a video conference and it gives them immediate insight into everything that is happening on a shared screen.</p><p>We’ve done some researches and find out some video conferencing services that offers screen sharing. In this article we are going to take you through the ten best options you can use free of charge.</p><h2 id="The-Ten-Best-Video-Conferencing-Software-That-Provide-Screen-Sharing-Options"><a href="#The-Ten-Best-Video-Conferencing-Software-That-Provide-Screen-Sharing-Options" class="headerlink" title="The Ten Best Video Conferencing Software That Provide Screen Sharing Options"></a>The Ten Best Video Conferencing Software That Provide Screen Sharing Options</h2><p>Even though each video conferencing software we included in this article can be used for free, some of the services offer only a limited set of options on their free versions. This means that the number of participants or the maximum duration of a group meeting can be restricted.</p><p>Purchasing a subscription plan is your only option if you want to be able to use all tools these video conferencing services have to offer. Here are the ten best video conferencing software products that provide screen sharing features.</p><h3 id="1-GoToMeeting"><a href="#1-GoToMeeting" class="headerlink" title="1. GoToMeeting"></a>1. GoToMeeting</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, pricing plans start at $12.00 per month</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, web</p><p>There are only a handful of video conference services out there that offer more than GoToMeeting. You can use this app directly from your web-browser, on your Smartphone or Macs and PCs. The free version of GoToMeeting includes the screen sharing feature and it provides webcam support.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gotomeeting-screen-sharing.jpg"                      alt="GoToMeeting Screen Sharing options"                ></p><p>Sharing a screen with GoToMeeting is a simple process that can be completed in just a few easy steps regardless of the device you’re using. However, if you opt for the free version of this video conferencing service you won’t be able to host meetings that have more than three participants. Furthermore, the maximum duration of a group meeting is limited to just forty minutes which makes the free version of GoToMeeting a good option just for individuals and small businesses. If you want to have access to unlimited cloud recording, automatic transcription or keyboard and mouse sharing options you will have to purchase the Business or Enterprise subscription model.</p><h3 id="2-Zoom"><a href="#2-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="2. Zoom"></a>2. Zoom</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, pricing options start at $14.99 per month</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, web</p><p>In case you are looking for a video conferencing service that allows you to host meetings that have up to a hundred participants for free, then Zoom is the right choice for you. Moreover, the platform doesn’t limit the number of meetings you can host, although hosting meetings that are longer than forty minutes is not possible on the free version of Zoom.</p><p>As a host of a Zoom meeting, you can enable one or more participants to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >share screens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> simultaneously. The service also allows the host to disable this option entirely or to choose which participants can have access to this option during a meeting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-screen-to-share-on-zoom.jpg"                      alt="Share Screen on Zoom"                ></p><p>Zoom cannot display more than 25 screens within the same window, which can limit your options if you are hosting a meeting with a large number of participants. You can<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record all of your meetings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to a local hard drive if you are using the Mac or PC version of Zoom, but you must upgrade to a paid version of Zoom if you want to store your recordings on the cloud.</p><p>Want to record the Zoom meeting but no permission yet, check some of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best free screen recorder for Zoom Meetings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h3 id="3-Cisco-Webex"><a href="#3-Cisco-Webex" class="headerlink" title="3. Cisco Webex"></a>3. Cisco Webex</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, pricing plans start at $14.00 per month</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, iOS, Android</p><p>Entrepreneurs who want to host meetings with up to a hundred participants for free should consider using Cisco Webex. In addition, you can use a number of devices such as the Cisco Webex Board, room or desk devices for your presentations and meetings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/webex-screen-sharing.jpg"                      alt="Share Screen on Cisco Webex"                ></p><p>Screen sharing is just one among countless options you will have at your disposal if you opt for the free version of Cisco Webex since this video conferencing service enables you to choose between different view outlines, create personal rooms or share files without any limitations. What’s more, you can host an unlimited number of meetings that can last for as long as you want, because there are no restrictions regarding the maximum duration of a meeting. The screen sharing feature is available even on the Cisco Webex mobile app so that you can share your device’s screen even if you are attending a meeting from you phone.</p><h3 id="4-Skype"><a href="#4-Skype" class="headerlink" title="4. Skype"></a>4. Skype</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS, iOS, Android</p><p>Skype is probably one of the oldest applications that provides video call services to its users for nearly two decades. Besides offering video chat and messaging tools, Skype also allows you to organize conference calls with up to fifty participants. All you need to do in order to create a conference call on Skype is to generate a call link with a single click and then share the invitations with the participants who can join the call via the unique link you send to them.</p><p>Each participant in a conference call can share their screen at any point in the meeting which makes the collaboration between different team members easier. You can record all your conference calls and Skype is going to store them for an entire month before deleting them. However, Skype offers fewer options than most video conferencing services, since you can’t schedule meetings in advance, create private rooms or adjust the meeting’s settings.</p><h3 id="5-Apache-OpenMeetings"><a href="#5-Apache-OpenMeetings" class="headerlink" title="5. Apache OpenMeetings"></a>5. Apache OpenMeetings</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, Linux, Ubuntu</p><p>This open-source software is equipped with a broad range of video conferencing tools that enable you to schedule meetings, send instant messages or even edit documents. The maximum number of participants in a meeting depends on the type of meeting you select since you can create conference rooms with up to 32 participants, webinars with up to a hundred attendees or interviews that can’t include more than two persons.</p><p>It is hardly surprising that Apache OpenMeetings allows its users to share screens during video calls because the software is stacked with features that can potentially make the collaboration between team members more productive. In addition, you can record all video conferences you organize with this software, although you can only store footage on your local hard drive. Apache OpenMeetings is far from easy to use, and you are going to need some coding experience in order to optimize the software in accordance with your needs.</p><h3 id="6-Join-Me"><a href="#6-Join-Me" class="headerlink" title="6. Join.Me"></a>6. Join.Me</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, pricing plans start at $10 per month</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows, iOS, Android</p><p>Even though hosting meetings on Join.Me used to be free, the company discontinued the free version of the software a little over a year ago. Currently, you can only host a meeting on Join.Me if you purchase a monthly subscription, but participants don’t have to pay a fee in order to attend a meeting.</p><p>In case you opt for the least expensive Lite subscription model you will be able to host meetings that have up to five participants, although the webcam streaming option is not going to be available.

Recording a meeting is not possible with the free version of the software, while the scheduling options leave much to be desired regardless of the pricing model.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>A simple feature like screen sharing can make a world of difference for your team’s productivity, as it enables the participants in a meeting to present their ideas or collaborate on a document effortlessly.

Educators, online marketers, and bloggers who want to create a strong bond with their audience should strive to offer something different and unique. Webinars have been largely accepted as one of the most efficient ways of establishing personal contact with the people interested in a particular subject or a product presented in the webinar. However, webinar software is also frequently used to improve internal communication within a team or a company or to train the newcomers and introduce them to the daily tasks on their new job.</p><p>Having a great idea for a webinar is just the first step in the process of creating successful visual content that generates profits, and in this guide, we are going to take you through each step of the process of choosing not only the best but the right webinar software that will meet all of your demands, and we will also introduce some of the best webinar software that you can use for different occasions.</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >8 Best Open Source Video Conferencing Software for Enterprise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a href="#section1">Section 1: Brief Intro about Webinar and how to choose Webinar software</a></li><li><a href="#section2">Section 2: Top 10 Best Webinar Software in 2024 [Free &amp; Paid]</a></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-A-Webinar"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-A-Webinar" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is A Webinar?"></a>Part 1: What Is A Webinar?</h2><p>Any video that includes a person (Presenter) explaining a certain problem or presenting services and products to an active or passive audience can be regarded as a webinar. Most events are broadcasted live, although On-Demand webinars or Evergreen webinars as they are sometimes referred to, allow you to use the existing material and simulate the live broadcast experience.</p><p>Live meetings online in which a single person or several speakers discuss, present or demonstrate a certain topic, information or a product are called webinars. The audience of a webinar varies from a single person up to 5.000 people depending on the purpose and the software that is being used for the production of a webinar. This process may sound daunting at first, but with time and experience, you’ll come to realize why most online marketers think that webinars are the second most effective b2b marketing strategy.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-a-Webinar-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-a-Webinar-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does a Webinar Work?"></a>Part 2: How Does a Webinar Work?</h2><p>A web-based seminar is run by a presenter, a person who provides information relevant to the webinar’s topic to attendees. In order to record a webinar, you’ll need a computer that is equipped with a webcam, a pair of headphones and a microphone, or you can use a Smartphone as an alternative. Most webinar software products offer tools that enable the presenter to insert all types of documents, draw on the screen and use other methods of explaining the topic to the viewers.</p><p>Participants can ask questions, post comments or even speak during a webinar if they are granted permission, and the presenter can answer questions or explain some aspects of the topic in more detail. Once the session is over, all participants of a webinar receive a video recording so they can rewatch it or go through the parts of the session they’ve missed.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-is-a-Webinar-Software"><a href="#Part-3-What-is-a-Webinar-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What is a Webinar Software?"></a>Part 3: What is a Webinar Software?</h2><p>Besides the hardware, you will also need the proper software to set up your first webinar. Even though live streaming is possible without the use of software products that are optimized for webinar creation, most computer programs for production of webinars offer powerful tools that broaden the range of things you can do while broadcasting.</p><p>A well-rounded webinar software enables you to set up a registration page, chat with participants or use pop-up windows that allow attendees to purchase the products or services you’re offering. However, the key ingredient of any powerful webinar software are the metrics tools that let you monitor user engagement and other statistics that are important to the success of your webinars.</p><h2 id="Part-4-4-Types-of-Webinars"><a href="#Part-4-4-Types-of-Webinars" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 4 Types of Webinars"></a>Part 4: 4 Types of Webinars</h2><p>On-demand and live webinars can cover a wide range of topics that have different objectives. Education and promotion are the most common reason to produce a webinar, so here are a few ideas that can help you choose the subject of your first webinar:</p><h4 id="1-Tutorial-Webinar"><a href="#1-Tutorial-Webinar" class="headerlink" title="1. Tutorial Webinar"></a>1. Tutorial Webinar</h4><p>This is probably the most popular type of a webinar because tutorials help people solve problems and accomplish things they struggled with. Your webinars can show viewers how they can perform color grading on their videos, build a dog house for their children or make a delicious ice cream, the options are unlimited. The only prerequisite is to be really good at what you are explaining, since talking about topics you don’t know much about, can hardly lead you to success.</p><h4 id="2-Tech-Training-Webinar"><a href="#2-Tech-Training-Webinar" class="headerlink" title="2. Tech Training Webinar"></a>2. Tech Training Webinar</h4><p>Technology and software are developing at an astounding rate, so most of us are having trouble to keep up with all the latest apps and software products that emerge on the market almost on a daily basis. You can use a webcam, a screen recorder or any type of camera to teach others how to use apps, software or any other modern technology.</p><h4 id="3-Reviews-and-Website-Audits"><a href="#3-Reviews-and-Website-Audits" class="headerlink" title="3. Reviews and Website Audits"></a>3. Reviews and Website Audits</h4><p>A lot of small brands and companies are struggling when it comes to online presentation, which is the reason why creating a webinar that offers in-depth analysis of their blog, website or sales page can prove to be very useful to the participants of your webinars. What’s more, you can offer constructive critique of almost anything, as long as it is relevant to the target group you’re addressing.</p><h4 id="4-Software-Demonstrations"><a href="#4-Software-Demonstrations" class="headerlink" title="4. Software Demonstrations"></a>4. Software Demonstrations</h4><p>Companies that manufacture software as well as individuals who consider themselves experts for a particular software can create webinars that demonstrate how a computer program is used properly. Even the high-end professionals encounter problems while using a software, which means that your audience can include inexperienced and skilled users.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Aspects-Worth-Considering-Before-Choosing-the-Best-Webinar-Software"><a href="#Part-5-Aspects-Worth-Considering-Before-Choosing-the-Best-Webinar-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Aspects Worth Considering Before Choosing the Best Webinar Software"></a>Part 5: Aspects Worth Considering Before Choosing the Best Webinar Software</h2><p>The decision to start producing webinars shouldn’t be taken lightly, because creating a successful webinar is anything but an easy task. You should do everything in your power to approach this task prepared since a simple mistake can ruin a lot of work.</p><h4 id="1-Define-Your-Goals"><a href="#1-Define-Your-Goals" class="headerlink" title="1. Define Your Goals"></a>1. Define Your Goals</h4><p>Being successful requires you to know your goals, so before you start producing webinars you have to define what you want to accomplish and work on it patiently. Masterclasses, One-On-One sessions in which you share your expertise or customer training webinars can all be on the list of your objectives, but you should only make webinars that are directly related to your area of expertise.</p><h4 id="2-Target-Audience"><a href="#2-Target-Audience" class="headerlink" title="2. Target Audience"></a>2. Target Audience</h4><p>Who is your ideal webinar attendee? How old is this person, and where do they live? These are some of the questions that might help you define your target audience and adjust the content of your webinar to the level of skills and knowledge an ideal participant of your webinar has. Knowing who your audience is, will also help you establish a stronger bond with the attendees of the webinars you are producing.</p><h4 id="3-Choose-the-Right-Software"><a href="#3-Choose-the-Right-Software" class="headerlink" title="3. Choose the Right Software"></a>3. Choose the Right Software</h4><p>The type of webinar you want to create will point you in the direction of the best webinar software for the job. Simple online applications like Google + Hangouts or Facebook Live can be a perfect solution if you’re looking for an efficient and easy way to broadcast your content live, but if you are more interested in the production of On-Demand webinars then Zoom or GoToWebinar platforms are a much better choice for you.</p><h4 id="4-Pricing"><a href="#4-Pricing" class="headerlink" title="4. Pricing"></a>4. Pricing</h4><p>Most professional webinar software are expensive, and if you have no intention of using the advanced features they offer, then there is no reason to invest in them. However, if you want to sell products, draw on the screen during a webinar or keep track of the user engagement statistics for each webinar you produce, investing in the right webinar software may prove to be essential for the success of your webinars.</p><h2 id="Part-6-What-Makes-a-Good-Webinar-Software"><a href="#Part-6-What-Makes-a-Good-Webinar-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: What Makes a Good Webinar Software?"></a>Part 6: What Makes a Good Webinar Software?</h2><p>There are a lot of factors that should be taken into consideration when trying to determine whether or not the webinar software meets the industry standards. A good webinar software offers features that make the process of creating a webinar smooth while enabling you to focus on the quality of the content you’re producing. Here are a few options that make a webinar software great.</p><h4 id="1-The-Content-Authoring-Tools"><a href="#1-The-Content-Authoring-Tools" class="headerlink" title="1. The Content Authoring Tools"></a>1. The Content Authoring Tools</h4><p>Setting up webinar registration pages, chatting with the participants of your webinar or selling products during a webinar are just a few among many authoring tools you will need to make your presentations look professional. The webinar software that doesn’t provide a rich selection of content authoring tools may limit your possibilities and reduce the maximum reach a webinar can have.</p><h4 id="2-Integrations-and-Engagement-Tracking-Systems"><a href="#2-Integrations-and-Engagement-Tracking-Systems" class="headerlink" title="2. Integrations and Engagement Tracking Systems"></a>2. Integrations and Engagement Tracking Systems</h4><p>Numbers matter. A scientific approach to webinars will enable you to stay ahead of the competition and to keep track of how well your content is performing. Besides powerful tools for measuring metrics a good webinar software should also offer social media integrations, so you can reach even more people who might be interested in what your webinars have to offer.</p><h4 id="3-Interactivity"><a href="#3-Interactivity" class="headerlink" title="3. Interactivity"></a>3. Interactivity</h4><p>Being able to communicate with your audience, through live chat or video messages and to respond to each question they might have will improve your chances to make a sale or to develop a loyal fan-base that follows each of your webinars. Some webinar hosting platforms allow you to have more than just one speaker, so webinar attendees can share their opinions and feel more involved in the discussion that is taking place.</p><h4 id="4-Branding-or-White-Labeling"><a href="#4-Branding-or-White-Labeling" class="headerlink" title="4. Branding or White Labeling"></a>4. Branding or White Labeling</h4><p>A good webinar software should help you raise brand awareness. You should be able to add logos to everything you offer through your webinars, use the brand’s colors or even include the brand’s promo materials in a webinar. Customizing webinars will help you fans recognize your work, but putting too much accent on the promotion of your brand can come across as too aggressive, so it is important to find the right measure in branding and white labeling.</p><p>Creating webinars is not a complicated process, but it does require preparation. The information we provided above should help you find the right webinar software that will enable you to produce visual content of the highest quality.</p><h2 id="Part-7-10-Best-Free-and-Commercial-Software-Products-for-Webinars"><a href="#Part-7-10-Best-Free-and-Commercial-Software-Products-for-Webinars" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: 10 Best Free and Commercial Software Products for Webinars"></a>Part 7: 10 Best Free and Commercial Software Products for Webinars</h2><p>Staying ahead of your competition and keeping pace with all the latest technology trends is essential if your goal is to conquer new markets or to lead teams that have great chemistry. Only a few decades ago, it was impossible to hold a conference video call that included more than thirty people, while online training courses were regarded as science fiction. The Internet, webcams, and screen capturing software have changed all this, and today we can easily produce software walk-throughs, eLearning content and a wide variety of video content that enables us to establish strong relationships with potential clients.</p><p>Choosing the webinar software that is capable of meeting all of your demands might be more challenging than it seems because there are thousands of webinar software products available. That’s the reason why we’ve put together the list of the ten best webinar software products, so let’s dive in and explore the premier options for bloggers, entrepreneurs and everyone else who wants to create webinars.</p><table><thead><tr><th>App Name</th><th>Best For</th><th>Pricing</th><th>Platform</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Google + Hangouts</td><td>Corporate communication and non-commercial webinars</td><td>Free</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>YouTube Live</td><td>Entrepreneurs who are learning how to create a webinar</td><td>Free</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook Live</td><td>Establishing a better bond with an existing audience on Facebook</td><td>Free</td><td>iOS, Android</td></tr><tr><td>WebinarJam</td><td>Selling products during a webinar, live chat with participants of a webinar</td><td>$39,99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>EverWebinar</td><td>On-Demand Webinars</td><td>$41 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>GoToWebinar</td><td>Large marketing teams</td><td>Plans start at $89</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Zoom</td><td>Educators, large companies, marketing teams</td><td>$14,99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Livestorm</td><td>Analytics oriented marketers</td><td>$99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>ClickMeeting</td><td>In-company meetings, all types of webinars</td><td>Pricing plans start at $25</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>GetResponse</td><td>All types of webinars</td><td>Pricing plans start at $49</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h4 id="1-Google-Hangouts"><a href="#1-Google-Hangouts" class="headerlink" title="1. Google + Hangouts"></a>1. Google + Hangouts</h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Corporate communication and non-commercial webinars</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>The Google’s product lets you invite as many as thirty participants to a webinar, and if you want, you can also broadcast the webinar on YouTube Stream. All broadcasting sessions are recorded and stored on the YouTube channel you used to broadcast a webinar, and the owner of the channel can make the video private or public. However, the Google + Hangouts app has gone through a lot of changes over the last few years, and on March 9, 2017, Google has announced that it will divide Hangouts into two products, Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet.</p><p>Companies that employ large numbers of people often use Google + Hangouts because it enables more than one participant of the webinar to speak and because new members can easily join the webinar. This app isn’t perfectly suited for commercial use since it doesn’t allow you to set a fee for joining the event.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> A great tool for webinars that have a lot of participants, especially if there are several speakers. The app lets you upload webinars to YouTube and share them effortlessly.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Creating paid events or keeping track of the metrics is not on the list of options Google + Hangouts offers, and you need to create an account on Google before you can join a webinar.</p><h4 id="2-YouTube-Live"><a href="#2-YouTube-Live" class="headerlink" title="2. YouTube Live"></a>2. YouTube Live</h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Entrepreneurs who are learning how to create a webinar</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>YouTube is the largest online video sharing platform in the world that offers most of its services for free. The YouTube Live feature enables its users to stream live footage captured with screen recording software or webcams and to invite as many viewers to their webinars as they want. Anyone who has a link can join the broadcast, but replying to messages and comments viewers post during a webinar is needlessly complicated.</p><p>Besides, making communication with the participants of a webinar almost impossible, YouTube Live also doesn’t feature a lot of marketing tools that can boost the sales of the products you’re offering. To make things even worse, your broadcasts may have a lag that can be as long as 40 seconds, so paying attention to how you set up your webinars can be crucial for their success.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to use and enables even the most inexperienced vloggers, eLearning content creators, and marketers to produce and share webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited interaction with viewers as well as the lack of advanced features for marketing products make YouTube Live only suitable for newcomers to the world of webinars.</p><h4 id="3-Facebook-Live"><a href="#3-Facebook-Live" class="headerlink" title="3. Facebook Live"></a>3. Facebook Live</h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Establishing a better bond with an existing audience on Facebook</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>Facebook, like many popular social media networks, has integrated live streaming into the services it provides. Besides enabling you to create webinars, Facebook Live also lets its users produce any other type of live stream, but only with a Smartphone. The conventional webcam method of recording webinars is not available on Facebook Live, and the app doesn’t offer any features for customization of webinars.</p><p>The number of people watching your live stream cannot surpass the number of friends you have on your Facebook account, which means that you can’t use this app to reach new clients. However, if you have a loyal fan-base on this social network, Facebook Live can help you develop a better relationship with people who already follow your work. Even though creating webinars with Facebook Live is possible, professionals will be better off using some more powerful webinar software.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Anyone who has a Facebook account can install and use Facebook Live for free, to capture handheld footage for their webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> No other features besides the live streaming option and you can’t record webinars with a webcam.</p><h4 id="4-WebinarJam"><a href="#4-WebinarJam" class="headerlink" title="4. WebinarJam"></a>4. WebinarJam</h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Selling products during a webinar, live chat with participants of a webinar</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Pricing plans start at $39,99 per month billed annually</p><p>The web-based platform is designed to work seamlessly on any web-browser and any device, so its users won’t have to worry about the quality of their webinars. WebinarJam can be used for a wide array of different purposes including, Q&amp;As, presenting products or chatting with your fans. What’s more, as many as six co-presenters can speak in a single webinar, which makes WebinarJam an excellent option for roundtables and open debates about important topics.</p><p>This tool for the production of webinars enables you to capture high-definition footage, and it automatically records each session. WebinarJam also provides features such as pop-ups that let you sell products and services while the webinar is in progress. This and countless other options make WebinarJam platform a perfect tool for marketing teams. Some pricing plans offer you to have up to 3 webinars per month that have five hundred participants, while the content sharing capabilities are nothing short of impressive regardless of the pricing plan you choose.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Makes engaging the audience look easy through a rich selection of powerful tools that enable you to interact with viewers of your webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Pricey, and novice users may experience a steep learning curve</p><h4 id="5-EverWebinar"><a href="#5-EverWebinar" class="headerlink" title="5. EverWebinar"></a>5. EverWebinar</h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> On-demand Webinars</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $41 per month, billed annually</p><p>WebinarJam and EverWebinar were developed by the same team, although the two platforms offer somewhat different options. The EverWebinar is designed to facilitate and simplify the process of rebroadcasting On-demand webinars. Small and up-and-coming brands that can profit from replaying webinars that were already recorded, will find EverWebinar’s services perfectly optimized for this task.</p><p>You can schedule a new rebroadcasting session effortlessly and simulate the look and feel of the original webinar while increasing the user engagement by making the videos available for a limited amount of time. This process is automated, so you can focus on chatting with the webinar’s participants or work on other projects while the On-demand webinar is in progress. EverWebinar lets you create three types of webinars, live, hybrid and automated, and you just have to select the option that best fits your current needs.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Password protected webinar rooms, great metrics features and interactive displays that present your products and services to the audience.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires a professional level of marketeering skills</p><h4 id="6-GoToWebinar"><a href="#6-GoToWebinar" class="headerlink" title="6. GoToWebinar"></a>6. GoToWebinar</h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Large marketing teams and companies</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, Pricing starts at $89</p><p>The fact that 2.7 million webinars have been hosted on this platform in a single year, speaks a lot about the quality of the service GoToWebinar provides. This amazing webinar tool lets you create live events, produce interactive On-demand webinars or host events that include up to 5000 participants. Surveying the audience of a webinar and adding interactive polls or Q&amp;As is also an option you’ll have at your disposal if you decide to produce your webinars with GoToWebinar.</p><p>The online platform grants you access to advanced metrics so you can monitor how well your content is performing, which allows you to get leads and all other data you need to extend the reach of your webinars. GoToWebinar enables you to record your webinars and share them on YouTube or the GoToStage, an in-house video sharing platform that has millions of visitors.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Equally efficient at creating live and On-Demand webinars, high-end analytics tools, great for raising the brand awareness</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> The video files captured with GoToWebinar are stored on a computer, and they have to be uploaded manually on a desired video sharing platform, much more expensive than its competitors.</p><h4 id="7-Zoom"><a href="#7-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="7. Zoom"></a>7. Zoom</h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Educators, large companies, marketing teams</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> The Basic version is free, the Pro version costs $14,99 per month</p><p>This is a versatile webinar platform that is equally effective when utilized by eLearning content creators, entrepreneurs or marketers. The basic version of Zoom is free and it enables you to host events that have up to a hundred participants or have meetings that last up to 40 minutes. The number of meetings you can have in a single month is unlimited and the basic version of Zoom also offers video and web conferencing features, as well as group collaboration options.</p><p>If you would like to have admin controls or monitor the statistics of the webinars you’re producing, then the Pro version of Zoom is a much better choice. Regardless of the plan you purchase, the number of interactive participants will be limited to one hundred, but you’ll be able to have an audience that includes as many as 10.000 people, even though they won’t be able to interact with the content you’re presenting.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Affordable, and equipped with powerful tools for creating and recording a webinar</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Group meetings can’t last longer than 40 minutes, and the Zoom’s interface takes some time to get used to.</p><h4 id="8-Livestorm"><a href="#8-Livestorm" class="headerlink" title="8. Livestorm"></a>8. Livestorm</h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Analytics oriented marketers</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, pricing starts at $99 per month for Starter package</p><p>The greatest advantage Livestorm has over its competitors are the high-end analytics tools that provide the users with actionable insights.

None, however, have been stretched as far as roguelikes and roguelites. You’ve probably heard these terms used to describe recent hit games such as <em>Hades</em>, <em>Dead Cells,</em> and <em>Binding of Isaac</em> and have wondered if there’s a difference. While both of these game types share a lot of common elements and the lines between them are seemingly blurred, there is a clear distinction between roguelikes and roguelites.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/isaac-poster.jpg"                      alt="isaac-poster"                ></p><hr><p><strong>This article contains:</strong></p><hr><p>Part 1: What’s the Difference Between Roguelikes and Roguelites?</p><hr><h3 id="Rogue-Where-it-all-started"><a href="#Rogue-Where-it-all-started" class="headerlink" title="Rogue: Where it all started"></a>Rogue: Where it all started</h3><p>In order to best understand these two game genres, we must first analyze the origin of their namesakes. Way back in 1980, game designers Michael Toy and Glenn Wichman released an ASCII art dungeon crawler called <em>Rogue</em>. Inspired by the pen-and-paper RPG <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, this turn-based adventure game had players explore dungeons in which they fought monsters and gathered items to help them power up their characters. The game’s defining mechanic was <strong>permadeath</strong>. This meant that once your character died, it was literally the end. You couldn’t create a save nor revive your fallen hero in any way. Starting over meant a completely fresh game with a brand new character. What’s more is that starting a new game meant the dungeons were completely different, including enemy placement, room location, and item distribution. Every decision could mean either living and carrying on or dying and starting over, making the choices players made meaningful.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/michael-toy-glenn-wichman.jpg"                      alt="michael-toy-glenn-wichman"                ></p><h2 id="What-is-a-Roguelike-Game"><a href="#What-is-a-Roguelike-Game" class="headerlink" title="What is a Roguelike Game?"></a>What is a Roguelike Game?</h2><p>As the name implies, a roguelike - or roguelike - is a game that shares the same mechanics that defined <em>Rogue</em>. They have procedurally generated environments, making every playthrough feel completely fresh and different. Dying in a roguelike means all progress is lost, and you need to start over, no saves, no lives, no ifs nor buts. It’s at this juncture where some debate exists as to what truly defines a roguelike. There are fans out there who’ll tell you that a roguelike must not only share the mechanics but also the game’s layout and combat system. According to them, since <em>Rogue</em> was a top-down third-person turn-based RPG that played on a grid, all true roguelikes should then play and look the same. The other camp sees roguelikes as purely defined by true permadeath with some leniency afforded with regards to less important elements such as player perspective, combat systems, and screen orientation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rogue-poster.jpg"                      alt="rogue-poster"                ></p><h2 id="What-is-a-Roguelite-Game"><a href="#What-is-a-Roguelite-Game" class="headerlink" title="What is a Roguelite Game?"></a>What is a Roguelite Game?</h2><p>Roguelites - or rogue-lites - in essence, employ a lighter approach to implementing <em>Rogue</em>‘s key characteristics. For the most part, roguelites still have permadeath. If you die, then you have to start over. However, the <strong>key difference</strong> is that roguelites allow you to carry over some form of progress from one playthrough to the next. Depending on the game, the way progress is carried over varies. Some games allow you to unlock additional items that can drop in a given run. Others open up access to new areas or provide you with abilities that enable you to traverse towards new locations and expand your area of exploration.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unlock-hades.jpg"                      alt="unlock-hades"                ></p><p>Roguelites also have procedurally generated environments in a lot of cases. There are titles that have completely random level layouts and enemy placements. Others draw from a pre-defined set of layouts that are mixed and matched. Some titles may simply randomize more minute elements such as item placement and the locations of points of interest. Another way roguelites differ in the way they handle procedural generation is through seeded runs. A seed is essentially a run with pre-determined parameters, including enemy types and placements, level layout, and item availability. Seeding is also used to generate special challenge runs as well as enable custom modes. Whatever the case, roguelites have a tendency to reign in the chaos of fully procedurally generated game content.</p><p>It’s roguelites that are also usually a mix of different genres with <em>Rogue</em> style mechanics. From action RPGs to card games, the roguelite genre’s offerings are quite expansive. The leniency they give when it comes to permadeath and randomness affords developers more design space in which they can craft unique experiences.</p><hr><h2 id="A-Clear-Distinction"><a href="#A-Clear-Distinction" class="headerlink" title="A Clear Distinction"></a>A Clear Distinction</h2><p>Regardless of where you stand on what defines a faithful roguelike, the distinction between it and roguelites is quite straightforward. You know you are playing a roguelike when dying means you <strong>lose it all</strong>. No matter how far into the game you’ve progressed, one misstep means all of the time and work you put into your progress has come to an end. Roguelites, on the other hand, prefer to give you <strong>some sense of progression</strong>, making them <strong>friendlier</strong> for players who don’t want to play with the stress of potentially losing everything.</p><p>There’s an argument to be made that roguelikes give you a truly unique experience each time while roguelites end up becoming grindy and repetitive. When every little decision you make can lead you to lose your character and progress, you become more focused on your run, rather than the game as a whole. You’re forced to play your best, scrutinize every possible choice, and make meaningful comparisons between items and gear you come across. The risk is higher when playing roguelikes, but the reward and payoff of making it far in a run are quite big.</p><p>If you were to conclude that roguelikes are for the <strong>hardest of core gamers</strong> and roguelites are more <strong>casual</strong> in nature, you would be quite close to the mark. A lot of roguelite titles, however, have difficulty settings that can turn them into absolutely brutal experiences, rendering progress and unlocks less important than the player’s overall skill.</p><hr><p>Part 2: Examples of Roguelike and Roguelite Titles</p><p>If you’ve been meaning to dive into either or both of these genres, we’ve got a few titles for you to check out.</p><p><strong>You might also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Roguelike or Roguelite Games <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><hr><h3 id="Roguelike-Games"><a href="#Roguelike-Games" class="headerlink" title="Roguelike Games"></a>Roguelike Games</h3><p>For this list, we’re using the “true” definition of roguelike, meaning games that are almost exactly like <em>Rogue</em>.</p><h4 id="Nethack"><a href="#Nethack" class="headerlink" title="Nethack"></a>Nethack</h4><p><em>Nethack</em> is considered one of the most important roguelikes as it is as close to <em>Rogue</em> as a game can get. Apart from permadeath and procedurally generated environments, it shares a lot of <em>Rogue’s</em> core attributes, including the ASCII art style and screen layout. Compared to <em>Rogue</em>, <em>Nethack</em> has a much larger collection of enemies and items, making exploring its world more rewarding. <em>Nethack</em> also includes “conducts” which are special limitations players can choose to impose upon themselves in order to make the game even more challenging.</p><h4 id="Caves-of-Qud"><a href="#Caves-of-Qud" class="headerlink" title="Caves of Qud"></a>Caves of Qud</h4><p>Straying a bit from <em>Rogue’s</em> high fantasy setting, <em>Caves of Qud</em> mixes some science fiction into its world. Just like <em>Rogue</em>, dying means your progress goes caput. Environments, however, are only partially generated randomly, with some elements being pre-defined. The game also includes a robust mutation system to power up your character as well as quests and side-quests which you can choose to follow or ignore. On top of all this, <em>Caves of Qud</em> adds another layer of randomness through its procedurally generated political systems.</p><h4 id="Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup"><a href="#Dungeon-Crawl-Stone-Soup" class="headerlink" title="Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup"></a>Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</h4><p>Recognized as one of the best roguelikes of all time, <em>Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</em> is one of the true innovators of its space. Taking all of the core defining elements of <em>Rogue</em>, including its hyper retro art style, <em>DCSS</em> makes a concerted effort towards being more accessible. For starters, it offers a more user-friendly interface that brings all important information to the forefront. The developers also wanted to make its gameplay far easier to understand so that any person can pick it up and play without needing any convoluted prior knowledge of how the game works.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dungeon-crawl-stone-soup.png"                      alt="dungeon-crawl-stone-soup"                ></p><hr><h3 id="Roguelite-Games"><a href="#Roguelite-Games" class="headerlink" title="Roguelite Games"></a>Roguelite Games</h3><p>For this genre, we’ve chosen three games that are completely different to illustrate the wider variety of titles that exists within the roguelite space.</p><h4 id="Dead-Cells"><a href="#Dead-Cells" class="headerlink" title="Dead Cells"></a>Dead Cells</h4><p><em>Dead Cells</em> is an exploration-based action platformer (a.k.a. a metroidvania) with roguelite elements. Just like all _Rogue_-based games, dying in <em>Dead Cells</em> means you start over from the beginning. However, not <strong>all progress</strong> is lost. As you progress through various biomes of the game, you’ll unlock new traversal abilities that allow you to access new biomes and pathways. While some randomness exists in each biome, it feels less like levels are procedurally generated and more like a mixing of pre-determined layout components. You’ll also stumble upon blueprints for items which you can then spend Cells you gather to make the items available to drop in future runs. By beating the game’s final boss you can unlock progressively harder difficulties, making the game increasingly more brutal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/deadcells-poster.png"                      alt="deadcells-poster"                ></p><h4 id="Slay-the-Spire"><a href="#Slay-the-Spire" class="headerlink" title="Slay the Spire"></a>Slay the Spire</h4><p>One of the most highly praised indie games, MegaCrit’s <em>Slay the Spire</em> is a shining example of a perfect blend of genres. It’s a deckbuilding card game where you must climb the titular Spire while defeating enemies and bosses in turn-based card battles, so you can ultimately slay its heart. Each run consists of 3 Acts, each of which gives you choices of pathways that are procedurally generated. While enemy placement is somewhat controlled at first, it becomes more truly random the higher you climb. What makes StS particularly challenging is that it affords very few options to restore health so guarding your HP is vital. While death does mean you’ll have to start all the way from the bottom, you can unlock new cards for each of the game’s 4 classes as you level them up. The game also offers a wide variety of options for challenges and seeded custom runs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slay-the-spire.png"                      alt="slay-the-spire"                ></p><h4 id="Hades"><a href="#Hades" class="headerlink" title="Hades"></a>Hades</h4><p>Nominated for a Game of the Year award, <em>Hades</em> is a beloved title that has converted many gamers to the roguelite genre. Your aim in the game, as the son of Hades, is to escape the Ancient Greek hell and ascend to the top of Olympus with the rest of the pantheon. The gameplay is fast-paced action hack-and-slash but it’s in a top-down perspective which makes it feel a lot closer to <em>Rogue</em> than other games in the genre. It also has a lot of elements that are randomized, including the location of helpful shops. Your build will also feel wildly different between runs as even the Gods that appear to power you up are random as well as the abilities they offer you to choose from.</p><p><img
