## Part 1: How To Create a Google Meet on Laptop?

There are three different ways through which an individual can create and schedule a Google Meet session through their laptop.

* A user can **create Google Meet** conferences through Gmail
* They can schedule in a session on Google Calendar
* An individual can directly create a meeting through the Google Meet website

### 1. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Gmail

Scheduling a session through Gmail is fairly simple, for this all the user requires is access to a Gmail account and they are good to go. First what one must do is sign into their Gmail account and go to the homepage.

On the left side of their screen, they will see options under the “Meet” heading, one is “New Meeting” and the other is “Join a Meeting”. If you are looking to create a new meeting then click on the “New Meeting” option.

Once that option is clicked, the user will be redirected to a new page that contains a meeting link.

Over here there are three options. By clicking the “copy link” button, individuals can copy and share the link with people they would like to invite to the meeting.

If they want to directly share the link, they can also click the “Send Invite” button and copy the meeting invite from there as well as share via email.

![share google meet invitation link on Gmail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-google-meet-invite-link-gmail.jpg)

If individuals want to instantly create and start the session, they can click the “Start Now” option, and the meeting will automatically start.

## Part 3: How to Schedule and Create Google Meet Link For The Future?

There are times when individuals feel far more comfortable and organized knowing that they have pre-scheduled their meeting for the week. The best way to schedule and create Google Meet links for the future is through Google Calendar.

One must first redirect themselves to the Google Calendar homepage and click the create option in the top left corner of their screen.

They must then select “Event” and proceed from there.

![Create  google meet on Google Calendar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-calendar-google-meet-event.jpg)

A pop-up form will appear on the screen which requires information regarding the conference. If you are looking to create an event for the future, first give it a title in the title section. Then move on to the date and time section and set the date to a time in the future for when you require the session to take place.

You can change the date by clicking on the date in the form, then a drop-down menu will appear from which you can choose the required date. Follow the same process for the time as well.

Once you click save, the meeting will be confirmed and appear on your Google Calendar.

## Part 4: How to Get the Google Meet Link and Code?

There are numerous ways through which you can get the link to the session.

* Get a link from Google Calendar
* Get a link from Google Meet

If you are using Google Calendar to get the link, the process is fairly simple. Just go onto the Google Calendar homepage and if you have scheduled the event from before, click on the event you require a Google Meet link for. Upon Clicking on the event a popup will appear as shown below.

From the popup, click the “Copy Conference Info” button to get the link.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
On a split side, one can also get their hands on the link through Google Meet itself. They can go to the homepage and they will see a list of scheduled events for that day over there.

From there just click the event you require a link for and you will be redirected to the meeting joining page. From there, just copy the link from the search bar and voila, you are good to go!

## Part 5: How to Create Google Meet Permanent Link

Tired of creating the same meetings again and again? Then why not just create a recurring link, also known as a permanent link. The process of creating a permanent link is the same as scheduling a Google Meet through Google Calendar, except one additional step has been added.

Before clicking save, click the “Repeat” option and select the days you would like the meeting to repeat itself. Then for all those days, the same link will be used.

## Part 1: How To Create a Google Meet on Laptop?

There are three different ways through which an individual can create and schedule a Google Meet session through their laptop.

* A user can **create Google Meet** conferences through Gmail
* They can schedule in a session on Google Calendar
* An individual can directly create a meeting through the Google Meet website

### 1. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Gmail

Scheduling a session through Gmail is fairly simple, for this all the user requires is access to a Gmail account and they are good to go. First what one must do is sign into their Gmail account and go to the homepage.

On the left side of their screen, they will see options under the “Meet” heading, one is “New Meeting” and the other is “Join a Meeting”. If you are looking to create a new meeting then click on the “New Meeting” option.

Once that option is clicked, the user will be redirected to a new page that contains a meeting link.

A pop-up form will appear on the screen which requires information regarding the conference. If you are looking to create an event for the future, first give it a title in the title section. Then move on to the date and time section and set the date to a time in the future for when you require the session to take place.

You can change the date by clicking on the date in the form, then a drop-down menu will appear from which you can choose the required date. Follow the same process for the time as well.

Once you click save, the meeting will be confirmed and appear on your Google Calendar.

## Part 4: How to Get the Google Meet Link and Code?

There are numerous ways through which you can get the link to the session.

* Get a link from Google Calendar
* Get a link from Google Meet

If you are using Google Calendar to get the link, the process is fairly simple. Just go onto the Google Calendar homepage and if you have scheduled the event from before, click on the event you require a Google Meet link for. Upon Clicking on the event a popup will appear as shown below.

From the popup, click the “Copy Conference Info” button to get the link.

On a split side, one can also get their hands on the link through Google Meet itself. They can go to the homepage and they will see a list of scheduled events for that day over there.

From there just click the event you require a link for and you will be redirected to the meeting joining page. From there, just copy the link from the search bar and voila, you are good to go!

## Part 5: How to Create Google Meet Permanent Link

Tired of creating the same meetings again and again? Then why not just create a recurring link, also known as a permanent link. The process of creating a permanent link is the same as scheduling a Google Meet through Google Calendar, except one additional step has been added.

Before clicking save, click the “Repeat” option and select the days you would like the meeting to repeat itself. Then for all those days, the same link will be used.
