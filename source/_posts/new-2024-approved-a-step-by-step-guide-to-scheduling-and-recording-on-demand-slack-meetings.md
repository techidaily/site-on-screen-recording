1.Open your Slack account and choose a workspace. In the chatbox, click on the **Shortcut** icon.

![Click Shortcut Icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/click-shortcut-icon.jpg)

2.Scroll down to find the option of **Create Event** (To schedule a meeting this way, you must first install the Outlook Calendar or Google Calendar)

Here is how you can record Slack meeting.

1.Click on the **Apps**tab on the left side menu. Click on **Add** **apps**.

## Part 3: Slack Video Call Settings

Slack allows users to schedule a meeting with third-party apps or in Slack itself. You can just as easily have a Slack meeting using the in-built video call option.

You can either have a one-on-one video call in a DM chat or have a Slack meeting with 14 other participants through a channel video call. Either way, Slack has multiple video call settings to make your work and communication easier.

The settings tab in the video call enables you to create a name for the video call. There are also audio and video settings that can be changed to enhance the video call experience.

![Slack Video Call Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slack-video-call-settings.jpg)

Moreover, if you wish to stay on mute and still engage with the speaker, just click on the emoji on the screen. Select from a variety of reactions or type a text message right on the video screen.
