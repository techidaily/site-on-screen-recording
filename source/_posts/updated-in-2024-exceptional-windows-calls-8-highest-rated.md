### 3\. [Wire](https://wire.com/en/)

The online platform Wire is one of the best video calling apps for pcs. It takes a different approach from our list's other video calling apps.

The one that everyone knows by name (and by far the most popular video calling app for PCs) is Skype. It has tons of great features but grew to success in the days when calling was still expensive and video calling was almost unheard of.

Skype’s Main Features

Some of the things that earned Skype a place on our list of the best video chat apps for your PC include:

Another of the best video calling apps for pc is the Google Duo app. This is Google’s answer to Skype. It is designed to work across different devices so that you can communicate with friends, even if they are on a Smartphone or a tablet. It is fully compatible with all Google products, which is why it consistently ranks highly in reviews.

Google Duo’s Main Features
