## Part 1: How To Create a Google Meet on Laptop?

There are three different ways through which an individual can create and schedule a Google Meet session through their laptop.

* A user can **create Google Meet** conferences through Gmail
* They can schedule in a session on Google Calendar
* An individual can directly create a meeting through the Google Meet website

### 1. Creating Google Meet Sessions Through Gmail

Scheduling a session through Gmail is fairly simple, for this all the user requires is access to a Gmail account and they are good to go. First what one must do is sign into their Gmail account and go to the homepage.

On the left side of their screen, they will see options under the ‚ÄúMeet‚Äù heading, one is ‚ÄúNew Meeting‚Äù and the other is ‚ÄúJoin a Meeting‚Äù. If you are looking to create a new meeting then click on the ‚ÄúNew Meeting‚Äù option.

Once that option is clicked, the user will be redirected to a new page that contains a meeting link.

![ google meet invitation link on Gmail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gmail-google-meet-invitation-link.jpg)

Over here there are three options. By clicking the ‚Äúcopy link‚Äù button, individuals can copy and share the link with people they would like to invite to the meeting.

If they want to directly share the link, they can also click the ‚ÄúSend Invite‚Äù button and copy the meeting invite from there as well as share via email.

![share google meet invitation link on Gmail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-google-meet-invite-link-gmail.jpg)

Upon clicking the ‚ÄúShare Via Email‚Äù option, users will be redirected to a new tab where they can see an email pop up and from there, they can invite participants to the session through their email address, as indicated in the image below.

If individuals want to instantly create and start the session, they can click the ‚ÄúStart Now‚Äù option, and the meeting will automatically start.
