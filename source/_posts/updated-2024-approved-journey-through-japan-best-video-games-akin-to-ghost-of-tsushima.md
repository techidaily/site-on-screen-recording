This is another astounding game like Ghost of Tsushima. It is a battle-intense game that allows you to use melee combats to protect your people and kingdom. To stop the Sauron's army, you have to use the melee mastery and spiritual connection to use the power against the army. It seems impossible to stop this army at first sight, but when using your full potential and power gathered from spiritual beings, this is not a big deal to defeat them. This game contains a wide range of weapons to use and creatures to fight with. You have to use new strategies and plans to defeat them in the battle, making this game thrilling and adventurous.
