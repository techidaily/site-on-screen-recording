## Frequently Asked Questions about Video Conferencing Software

Here you will find some of the most commonly asked questions regarding free video conferencing or meeting software.

### 1\. Q) What is the best free video conferencing software?

A) That depends on your needs. For the most comprehensive plan, **Cisco** covers every aspect of the business through interchangeable features. For more extensive group chats, try **Zoom**, but do keep in mind the 40 minute limit on your call times. If your team speak different languages, then use **Skype** – who have a [real-time language-translation tool](https://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/2016/1212/Skype-s-real-time-language-translator-Can-it-really-connect-the-world) that shaves hours off your day. Lastly, **UberConference** is arguably the best free video conferencing software for companies who work with lots of different contractors or freelancers on a day-to-day basis. This is because you don’t need to download anything and can just jump straight in.

### 2\. Q) Is Zoom the same as Skype?

A) Not quite, Skype has more of an International calling focus, while Zoom is more business meeting and conference intuitive. Zoom takes webinars and video teaching and learning as more of a priority than Skype does. Skype, on the other hand, allows free international calling by assigning local caller ID to your number.

### 3\. Q) What is the best Video Conferencing Software for Small Businesses

A) UberConference should match your needs. It gives you the ability to communicate with up to 50 workers, more than enough for any small business. It also means you aren’t continually inviting contractors to download software. That being said, the type you use, or that best suits your firm, depends entirely on what you need it for and how you use it.

## To Conclude

There is a perfect video conferencing software app or program for everyone, but which suits your company best will depend on what your business is. We hope we have provided you with enough information that you can make a reasonable choice. What matters most is that you get online and work from home. Being indoors shouldn’t have to be the end of the world.

## Frequently Asked Questions about Video Conferencing Software

Here you will find some of the most commonly asked questions regarding free video conferencing or meeting software.

### 1\. Q) What is the best free video conferencing software?

A) That depends on your needs. For the most comprehensive plan, **Cisco** covers every aspect of the business through interchangeable features. For more extensive group chats, try **Zoom**, but do keep in mind the 40 minute limit on your call times. If your team speak different languages, then use **Skype** – who have a [real-time language-translation tool](https://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/2016/1212/Skype-s-real-time-language-translator-Can-it-really-connect-the-world) that shaves hours off your day. Lastly, **UberConference** is arguably the best free video conferencing software for companies who work with lots of different contractors or freelancers on a day-to-day basis. This is because you don’t need to download anything and can just jump straight in.

### 2\. Q) Is Zoom the same as Skype?

A) Not quite, Skype has more of an International calling focus, while Zoom is more business meeting and conference intuitive. Zoom takes webinars and video teaching and learning as more of a priority than Skype does. Skype, on the other hand, allows free international calling by assigning local caller ID to your number.

### 3\. Q) What is the best Video Conferencing Software for Small Businesses

A) UberConference should match your needs. It gives you the ability to communicate with up to 50 workers, more than enough for any small business. It also means you aren’t continually inviting contractors to download software. That being said, the type you use, or that best suits your firm, depends entirely on what you need it for and how you use it.

## To Conclude

There is a perfect video conferencing software app or program for everyone, but which suits your company best will depend on what your business is. We hope we have provided you with enough information that you can make a reasonable choice. What matters most is that you get online and work from home. Being indoors shouldn’t have to be the end of the world.
