### Step 3: Changing the Display of Air Circle

Additionally, Mobizen screen recorder APK offers you to minimize the Air Bubble icon and even get rid of it by inserting your own picture and replacing it. The transparency of the Air Circle can also be altered accordingly. The “Hide Mode” hides the icon altogether.

### Step 4: Adjusting the Settings

The “Facecam” feature can be enabled through “Settings,” and its size can be adjusted. As far as the watermark is concerned, you can use that of Mobizen or create your own. The beginners can even set the countdown timer greater than 3 sec to gather their thoughts. The software lets you annotate and draw as well. Enable the feature from the “Draw” tab.
