This is unlike in the case of other screen capture tools where you will be required to use an external tool for editing images. It also has an integrated feature that will allow you to easily share the captured and edited images, such as in online forums. Even if it is your first time using this screen shot tool, you will not experience any complication as it is built with the needs of users in mind.

Kazam is excellent because it offers versatility. If you do not want to record the entire screen, you will have the option to record only a selected area.

#### 8. [Record My Desktop](http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/about.php)

A first part is a command-line tool, which is basically the one that is responsible for capturing and encoding. The second part is an interface that exposes the functionality of the program.
