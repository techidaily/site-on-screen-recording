# Full Page Screen Capture: How to Capture Screenshots of a Full Page?

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

Producing business presentations, written analyses, or spreadsheets, is an inseparable part of everyday professional life. But, as you most probably know, most of these documents are large in size and somewhat difficult to share. Instead of wasting time waiting for a file to upload, you can simply take a screenshot and create a file that is easy to share within seconds.

On the other hand, The Internet contains such a vast amount of information, that it is sometimes easier to just capture an entire screen than it is to share a link. Luckily, you don't have to be a skilled photo editor who knows how to merge several screenshots of a scroll page of any kind, into a single image, because there are many easier ways to accomplish this task. Let's have a look at different methods of capturing screenshots of a full page.

* [Method 1: Full Page Screenshot without Hotkeys](#part1)
* [Method 2: Zooming Out the Page for Full-Screen Webpage Screenshots](#part2)
* [Method 3: Capturing Screenshots With Browser Extensions](#part3)
* [Method 4: Using Online Tools for Full Page Screenshots](#part4)
* [Method 5: Using Screen Capturing Software for Full Page Screenshots](#part5)

## Method 1: Taking Screenshots of an Entire Page on Windows Using The Hotkeys

Most frequently used web browsers such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, offer the Print option, so all you need to do in order to capture the whole page is to head over to the web page you'd like to capture, open the browser's File menu and then click on the **Print** feature. If it is easier, you can just hit the **CTRL + P** keyboard shortcut to launch the Print window.

![ Full Page Screenshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/print-chrome-full-page.jpg)

Once the printing dialogue box appears on the screen you'll be able to preview the pages of the document, adjust the printing options and select the file format. Click on the **Change** icon and select the **Microsoft XPS Document Writer**, if you are using Google Chrome to create a new document that contains the entire page. You can also create a PDF file, but this file format may include the ads or other overlaying elements on the web page. When done, click on the Print icon to save the document to the desired location on your hard drive.

## Method 2: Zooming Out the Page for Full-Screen Webpage Screenshots

If you'd like to avoid producing several screenshots that you'll later have to combine into a single image or a document, you can simply hold the **CTRL and -** keys on Windows or **Command - on** a Mac OS to zoom out the page and fit it into a screen.

To capture the resized screen, simply hold the **PrintScreen** button on your keyboard and the image will instantly be saved to the clipboard. Afterward, you have to paste the screenshot to a new document in any graphics editor, using the **CTRL and V** buttons. The **Cmd + Shift + 4** keyboard shortcut will enable you to take quick screenshots on a Mac computer, while the **Command + 0** will reset the browser to normal view.

## Method 3: Capturing Screenshots With Browser Extensions

Built-in screen capturing options on Windows and Mac offer only a limited amount of features and for that reason installing the browser extensions that enable you to capture scroll web pages may be a better option. Here are some of the best extensions for taking screenshots of full pages.

#### 1\. [Nimbus Screenshot](https://nimbusweb.me/)

Free and Pro versions of the extension are available for Opera, Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Google Chrome browsers. Even though the free version of FireShot provides all the tools you'll need to take a full page screenshot, the Pro version gives you access to better photo editing and file sharing tools.

#### 4\. [Awesome Screenshot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/awesome-screenshot-screen/nlipoenfbbikpbjkfpfillcgkoblgpmj?hl=en)

Click on **Done** when ready to save the image, and then proceed to save the screenshot as a PDF file on your computer or store it online.

[Firefox Quantum](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) browser allows you to quickly take screenshots of the full page without much hassle. Make sure that the tab with the web page you'd like to capture is open, and then click on the **Page Action** icon, that looks like three dots.

## Method 4: Using Online Tools for Full Page Screenshots

## Method 5: Using Screen Capturing Software for Full Page Screenshots

Stand-alone software products that enable its users to take screenshots of entire documents and web pages are a great choice for professionals that frequently need a powerful screen capturing tool. [Screenpresso,](https://www.screenpresso.com/) [FastStone Capture](http://www.faststone.org/FSCaptureDetail.htm) or [Snagit](https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html) are just a few screen recorders, that are capable of producing still and moving images of a computer display.

**Conclusion**
