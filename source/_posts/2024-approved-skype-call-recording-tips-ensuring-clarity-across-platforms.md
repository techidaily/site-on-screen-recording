## Part 2: How to Record Skype Meeting on Windows

Skype for Business allows you to record skype meetings on Windows PCs directly from its app. It’s an easy and straightforward method of recording your meeting and I’ll go through every step to show you how you can record your next Skype meeting.

* [**Download Skype for Business**](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/download-and-install-skype-for-business-on-windows-2da94a13-6d16-4d67-adf3-439f2b946994) to your computer and sign in with your business account.
