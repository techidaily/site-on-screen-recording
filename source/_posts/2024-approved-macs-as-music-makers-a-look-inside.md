**3\. Fast and convenient editing**

The user interface along with the software integration of macOS gives Sound Studio a very fast yet convenient editing studio feature. In this section, you will be able to create your audio in several layers and save it with different digital effects such as reverb, delays, chorus, or even flange filters.

The application also allows the users to visit their memory lane by helping them digitize the tapes as well as vinyl records from their PC itself. In this way, everyone can save their old dusty records into digital formats which will enable them to modify the voice configurations and then edit them with different layers of effects.

**5\. Batch processing using AppleScript or Automator**

For people who want to process their audio in a batch or want to combine different audio recordings at the same time, they can use the AppleScript or any Automator for the same since Sound Studio supports the integration of both thus enabling a more powerful part of audio processing.
