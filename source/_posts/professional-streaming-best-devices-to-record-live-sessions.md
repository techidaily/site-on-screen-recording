## Conclusion

Recording a live stream video conference call or corporate meeting is no more an issue. You can use online screen recorder Screencast-O-Matic or Google extension Screencastify. If you are hosting the live stream session yourself through Dacast or Restream, we will illustrate how you can use the platforms to record your live sessions. But the best way to record any live stream video is by using Wondershare Filmora.
