### Way 2\. Record iPhone Screen Through Mac

If your iPhone is running on an older version of iOS, you can still record your FaceTime video call with audio. For that, you need to connect your iPhone to your Mac and while you make the FaceTime call on your iPhone, it will be recorded through Mac. We will be using QuickTime Player on Mac to record your FaceTime call on iPhone. Here are the steps to follow rigorously.

Step 1: Connect your iPhone to your Mac through Lightning cable.

Step 2: Open QuickTime on your Mac and go to File> New Movie Recording.
