Minecraft is famous for its cube-shaped structure. The entire world of Minecraft is based on squares and cubes. Minecraft allows you to create amazing buildings, homes, and a kingdom. To make your buildings unique and different you can add different elements and shapes in your buildings such as circles, spheres, and curves. Circle and spheres are used as decorating materials and can be very helpful in creating different things and buildings. It seems impossible to build circles and spheres using cubes. You can create a circle and sphere easily by following simple steps. If you ever look at an image of a circle after zooming in, you will notice small pixels in the form of squares that are held together to create a circle. We can use such a technique to create a circle and sphere using cubic blocks in Minecraft. We can create pixelated circles and spheres without any curves. In this article, we will illustrate how to make a circle in Minecraft and how to make a sphere in Minecraft separately.

## How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide

If you have ever noticed that when we zoom in out images, small pixels are held together to form a perfect image. We have to apply the same method here. We have to take these cubes as pixels and connect them with each other for a complete picture to form a circle.

**Step 1:** The first step of how to make a circle in Minecraft is to decide the circumference of the circle you want to create. In this example, we are going to create a circle with a circumference of 17 blocks. You can choose any circumference depending upon the size of the circle you want. Place 17 blocks in a series to make a straight line. Now at the 9th block, which is the middle of the line, place two blocks perpendicular blocks on both sides of the line.

**Step 2:** Now add 7 blocks on each side of the line to make a plus '+' sign. It will create a circumference of the circle by both the x-axis and y-axis.

**Step 3:** At the edges of each line create a perpendicular line of 5 blocks each. This will create an outer boundary of the circle.

![minecraft-make-circle3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle3.jpg)

**Step 4:** Now to complete the outer boundary of the circle, you have to add two blocks in the same direction of the outer line of the circle. But this time come a little bit closer to the center of the circle.

**Step 5:** Complete the outer by adding an 'L' shaped structure created with 3 blocks on each of the four sides of the circle to complete the outer boundary.

**Step 6:** Since the outer of the circle is complete, now you can either remove the center lines of the circle to make it hollow or fill it with the blocks to make it a complete filled circle and make it a place where you can stand.

## How to make a Sphere in Minecraft

The only difference between making a circle and a sphere is the difference in dimensions. The circle is Two Dimensional and the sphere is three-dimensional. It is not as difficult as it seems.

**Step 1:** To get started, create a tall column of the block according to the size of the sphere that you want to make. In this example, we are going to form a 16 blocks long column. You can change it according to your requirement.

**Step 2:** Now it's time to create layers of the sphere. To do that you have to create a layer of 7 blocks wide on the top and the bottom of the column.

**Step 3:** Since you have created the 1st and the 16th levels of the sphere, now you have to follow this procedure for all remaining layers: Make a layer of 11 blocks for the 2nd and 15th levels.

![minecraft-make-sphere3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere3.jpg)

**Step 4:** Follow the same pattern throughout the levels: 13 blocks layer on 3rd and 14th level, 15 blocks on 4th and 13th levels, 17 blocks on 5th and 12th level, and so on. As you can notice that each new level comes with 2 extra blocks. Follow this process until you reach the middle of the column.

These circles and spheres are useful in Minecraft and they play a very vital role in building your own world in Minecraft. They can be very beneficial while creating buildings, houses, and more places. These can be used as curves to give your buildings an aesthetic look and feel. But this whole process needs practice and efforts to master it and use it for your own purposes.
