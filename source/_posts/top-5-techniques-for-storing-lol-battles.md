## Way 5\. Use Fraps to Record LOL Games

Last but for least, you can record game LOL even when you are playing the game on a Windows PC that has older Windows versions. It is not the most advanced gameplay recorder but it gets the job done. The user interface is old-fashioned and hence, simple to use. Here are the steps on how to record LOL gameplay with Fraps.

Step 1: Download and install Fraps on your Windows PC.

Step 2: Launch the software and go to General tab and turn on Monitor Aero Desktop option. This option will enable you to record the full screen.

Step 3: Under Movies tab, set all the parameters correctly.

Step 4: Open LOL and press F9 key to start recording the gameplay. Press F9 again to stop recording.

## The Bottom Line

League of Legends is a high-end game and you cannot let recording in the background to affect the performance and face lag issues. That is why you have to choose a gameplay recorder wisely if you want to record LOL games. We have picked the top five best gameplay recorders, some of which are premium while others are free. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as you can record at 4K resolution and edit your video to make it more interesting and eye-catching.
