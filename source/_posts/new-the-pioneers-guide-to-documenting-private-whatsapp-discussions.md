## The Pioneer's Guide to Documenting Private WhatsApp Discussions

WhatsApp is the most popular instant messaging app. Not just for instant messages, WhatsApp is also popular for its audio and video calling features. Most WhatsApp users use calling feature for personal communication. However, even corporates use WhatsApp to talk to team members and have a quick discussion. One of the common questions we come across from WhatsApp users “Can WhatsApp call be recorded?”

However, there is no default call recording option available. Therefore, you will need an external **WhatsApp call recording app** if you want to record your call on your Phone. Similarly, you will need an external software to record WhatsApp call on your computer. In this article, we will illustrate how to record a WhatsApp call in simple steps.

WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app among Android users. WhatsApp has literally replaced text messaging and its free audio call feature is widely used as an alternative to traditional call. At the same time, users prefer WhatsApp video call over audio call for personal communication with contacts. Due to its usage more for personal communication over professional communication, there is no WhatsApp record feature available for security and privacy reason.

That is why you will need an external screen recorder app and we recommend AZ Screen Recorder. The app is free to use and very easy to operate. With a single tap, you can record anything on the screen including WhatsApp call. Here are the steps to follow to record WhatsApp call on Android.
