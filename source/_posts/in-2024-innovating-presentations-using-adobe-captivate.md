When the new window opens, click on the Browse icon next to the Working Folder feature, and select insert the new destination folder for your video.

Hit the Record button to initiate the video recording session. You can hit the Esc or End buttons to stop recording if you are using a PC, while Mac users can perform the same action by hitting Cmd + Enter keys.
