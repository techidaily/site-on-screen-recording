There are several online screen video recorders available to choose from. However, not many have the necessary features for high-quality screen recording. Here are the main features that make a good online recorder.

Good Video Quality: A good screen recorder should let you record at the present screen resolution. Therefore, if you have a 4K monitor, you should be able to record the screen at 4K resolution. However, a minimum HD resolution is a must. A good screen recorder offers Full HD recording, while some offer 2K and 4K recording.

Capture Audio and Webcam: A good online video recorder lets you record your screen and your webcam with audio. This is useful when you want to record your screen, show your face, and give your commentary. Besides, you can also record your screen with internal audio or mic audio without a webcam. Therefore, go for a screen recorder with audio online and webcam capture.

User-Friendly Interface - The overall interface of the online screen recorder for PC has to be intuitive and user-friendly. This means you should be able to record with a minimum number of steps. Besides, customizing the settings should be easy, and the download option should be readily available. In addition, some screen recorders come with a basic video editor, which is an add-on.
