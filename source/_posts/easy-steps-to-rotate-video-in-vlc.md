Here are the steps to perform VLC rotate video.

Step 1: Open VLC Media Player.

Step 2: Go to Media > Open File option and select the video file that you want to rotate.

Step 3: Once the video opens, go to Tools > Effects and Filters option.

If you want VLC rotate video and save feature so that the video’s rotation angle changes permanently, take the following steps on Windows.

Step 1: Open VLC player and open the video file.

Step 2: Follow all the steps we have mentioned on Method 1 - How to rotate video in VLC on Windows?
