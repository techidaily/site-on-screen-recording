## Boosting Twitch Viewership: 5 Key Tactics

Twitch is an extremely popular live video streaming platform, especially among gamers. Unless Twitch streamers enable Video on Demand, the live stream will not be accessible to the viewers later. However, it is quite possible that you cannot watch a live stream completely because you are occupied with other important works, and that is when you can record Twitch stream so that you can watch it later whenever you have time.
