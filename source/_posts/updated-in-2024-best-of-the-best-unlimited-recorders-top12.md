## Best of the Best: Unlimited Recorders, #Top12

Video editing is one of the most common and useful tools in today’s environment because of the up rise of social media platforms, mainly: YouTube, Instagram, TikTok etc. So, video making and sharing is no longer a way of enjoying yourself but also a way to earn your lively hood. Now in case of shorter videos these variables really don’t really matter but when longer videos are to be made, normally for the purposes of education, game-streaming or documentaries these parameters can be the deciding and limiting factors. And from these factors the problem of time limited video recording is discussed below.

Default video recorders have a predefined limit to record for a certain time, which is a problem for lengthy videos and resetting the recording process can be very exhausting at times. So, to make impeccable videos, certain parameters have to be checked, other than the scene and setting itself, these parameters include video length, its quality and proper editing. Also, to tackle this problem the time-less recording or screen recording with no time limit is introduced. By using this tool long videos can be made without pause and later unwanted parts can be easily edited out of the video. There are different platforms available for the time-less screen recording, which are discussed below.

## 1\. Wondershare Filmora
