The settings tab in the video call enables you to create a name for the video call. There are also audio and video settings that can be changed to enhance the video call experience.

Moreover, if you wish to stay on mute and still engage with the speaker, just click on the emoji on the screen. Select from a variety of reactions or type a text message right on the video screen.
