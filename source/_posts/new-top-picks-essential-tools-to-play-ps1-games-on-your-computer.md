This emulator offers a variety of solutions and is just an emulator for playing PS1 video games, making it one of the best ps 1 emulators and most complete emulators. The first stable version was released in the year 2020, almost a decade after its launch in the year 2010\.

This emulator offers a variety of solutions and is just an emulator for playing PS1 video games, making it one of the best ps 1 emulators and most complete emulators. The first stable version was released in the year 2020, almost a decade after its launch in the year 2010\. On top of all that, it is free, open-source, and can emulate gaming consoles, media players, game engines, and others. That makes it a very reliable emulator.

**Features:**

* As a fast, portable, lightweight emulator, RetroArch requires no adjustments or very little tweaking to run and function properly.
* In terms of game-saving, refresh rate, game loading, and screen resolution, it is one of the best PS1 emulators out there.

### 2.Matsu Emulator

![matsu-emulator-ps1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/matsu-emulator-ps1.png)

There is also the Matsu Emulator, which is based on the PSX/PSOne platform. Despite being one of the best emulators in the world, it is also quite stable and safe. There are more and more features being added to the software. In contrast, the simulator works well but the free version has heavy advertising. If you purchase the pro edition in the game, you will be able to remove the advertisements. If you would like to pay someone for an emulator, we would recommend ePSXe or FPse. You will find Matsu Emulator to be a reliable and efficient program if you can endure its commercials.

**Features:**

* It features an on-screen virtual keypad as well as support for gamepads.
* The sound quality is excellent.
* As well as fast-forwarding, it also supports rewinding.

Games are run using OpenGL and SDL in Mednafen, a multi-system emulator. Users can remap hotkeys and virtual system inputs to joysticks or keyboards, or both simultaneously. Rewinding in real-time and saving at multiple states are supported by the emulator. It also allows you to take screenshots instantly. Pictures are saved as PNG files.

The majority of Mednafen's cores are portions from other applications, but some are originals. In terms of quality, precision, and compatibility, its original cores (built to run PS1, Sega Saturn, and Nintendo Virtual Boy games) are noteworthy. The command-line interface of Mednafen is easy to use. Additionally, it supports several third-party GUIs to make configuration even easier. For example, MedLaunch offers a dynamic games library with DAT lookup and online scraping and the ability to configure controllers.

**Features:**

* Multi-platform emulation allows games to be played on PlayStation One as well as other gaming consoles.
* Compatible with most gaming consoles, including the PlayStation One, it is very accurate in its compatibility.
