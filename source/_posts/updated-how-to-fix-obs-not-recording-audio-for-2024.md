## Conclusion

When recording from OBS studio, if the desktop audio section does not react to any audio, you will not hear the noises from the computer in your recordings. To discover whether OBS pulls up any audio from the PC, check the Audio Mixer. OBS studio is one of the most wonderful free screen recording apps which is not difficult to apply, particularly for YouTubers. Make sure to follow all the remedies one by one and go through the reasons owing to why it is triggered in the first place. If you are encountering the problem with OBS not recording audio, you might utilize an alternative to OBS studio.
