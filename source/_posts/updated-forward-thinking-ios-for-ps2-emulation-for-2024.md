### 4.RetroArch Emulators for iOS

![retroarch-emulators-for-ios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/retroarch-emulators-for-ios.png)

However, the RetroArch emulator for iOS is yet another best PS2 emulator iPhone. Because the PPSSPP can only be used on Jailbroken iPhones, this app isn't as efficient as the PPSSPP. This implies that you'll need to have your iPhone jailbroken in order to use this app.

However, unlike other PS 2 emulators for iOS, it does support a number of PS2 titles, although it's a little complex. PPSSPP or indeed the Happy Chick iOS emulators would suffice, and RetroArch would be unnecessary.

**Features:**

* Automatic Controller Configuration
* Recording & Streaming
* Highly Configurable
