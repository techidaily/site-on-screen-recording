### Step 2: Altering the Settings

Adjust the settings of your screen recording. The first functionality is “Video Settings.” Tap on it to alter the resolution, FPS, and quality of the video. The “Clean Recording Mode” can be enabled as per user needs. It helps get rid of the watermark as well as the floating icons.

### Step 3: Changing the Display of Air Circle

Additionally, Mobizen screen recorder APK offers you to minimize the Air Bubble icon and even get rid of it by inserting your own picture and replacing it. The transparency of the Air Circle can also be altered accordingly. The “Hide Mode” hides the icon altogether.
