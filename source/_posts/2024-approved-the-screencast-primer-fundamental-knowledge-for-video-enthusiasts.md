Zoom Effect – One of the unique features of Screencast-O-Matic is that it lets you zoom any portion of the screen for better viewing while recording. This is very useful while making tutorial videos where you focus on specific options and zoom in on the options.

Edit Videos – Editing the recorded video is as important as recording the video.
