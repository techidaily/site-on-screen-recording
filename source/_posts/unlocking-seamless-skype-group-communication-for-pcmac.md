Have some questions about skype group video chat? Keep the following!

### Q1: How many people can you have on a Skype group chat?

Skype group video chat enables up to 50 people to meet and cooperate all at once. The group screen sharing option allows the presenter to share PowerPoint slides, video recordings of the skype meeting, and much more. Making long-distance learning a possible reality for students all around the world and enabling remote co-workers to work on projects efficiently. Assign project modules and discuss due dates with more productive face-to-face conversations via Skype group video calling.

### Q2: Is it no longer possible to block individual contacts on Skype?

Skype enables you to block a contact to prevent them from sending you instant messages, calling you, and seeing your state on Skype, in effect blocking their access to your Skype profile. While the company also allows you to report the contact as abusive which can notify the company moderators to stop the spammers from an early stage and not allow them to torture other Skype users.

You can in effect block a contact in Skype

* 1\. Go to the “Recent Chats” or “Contacts” tab and select the contact you want to block.
* 2\. Right-click the contact name and chose the “View profile” option from the menu.
* 3\. In the profile of the contact, member scroll down to the bottom of the profile window and click the red colored “Block contact” option.

Tips:

In case you receive an unwanted call from an unknown number, you have the privilege to block the number right ways from the chat. Just press the “Block + the number” link to block a particular number.

### Q3: How do I delete all contacts on a Skype list with one click?

Every once in a while, you may find some contacts you no longer need in your Skype contacts – particularly after a quick call or a job interview. Generally, to delete a contact you’ll have to view the person’s profile details and then press the “Remove from contact list” option, but here I’ll be showing you a fairly easy and simple way to delete all your contacts at once.

### Q3: How do I delete all contacts on a Skype list with one click?

Every once in a while, you may find some contacts you no longer need in your Skype contacts – particularly after a quick call or a job interview. Generally, to delete a contact you’ll have to view the person’s profile details and then press the “Remove from contact list” option, but here I’ll be showing you a fairly easy and simple way to delete all your contacts at once.

To delete all your Skype contacts at once follow the steps:

* 1\. Open Skype app and press the menu bar right next to your name. Select “Settings” to open the settings of Skype.

![view list](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-list8.jpg)

## Conclusion

## Part 1: Make a Skype Group Chat on Windows

Communicating with multiple people simultaneously from different parts of the world in real-time couldn’t be thought of some years ago. However, today Skype group chat makes it possible for anyone to connect and collaborate with several people without any barriers and limitations.

To make a group chat on Skype using a Windows operating system you can get connected with individuals from diverse localities of the world within a minute. To make a Skype group chat for yourself follow along with the steps below.

* [**Download Skype**](https://www.skype.com/) on your Windows PC. You’ll need to sign in with a Microsoft account or sign up if you haven’t already had a Skype account.
* Once you’ve logged in to Skype you’ll be presented with a similar interface with “Recent Chats” showing up in the left pane. To make a group chat click on the drop-down icon next to the “New Chat” button and select “New Group Chat” and your new Skype group chat is only a few clicks away.

![new group chat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-group-chat1.jpg)

* A new window will appear in the Skype main screen. Here you’ll have to write the name of the group and select a picture for the group chat. The name should represent the purpose of the chat group to make sense to its participants, I’ve selected a figurative name for the sake of an example. After you’re done with the name and picture, press the ahead arrow.

![create group name](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-group-name2.jpg)

* Skype will take you to your contact list to choose the members for your new chat group. You can skimp through the whole list or search the name in the search bar to look for a particular person. Once you’re done selecting all your contacts press the “Done” button and Skype will create your new shiny group within a minute.

Skype allows anyone to create a group chat on Mac. You can easily create and enjoy your Skype group chat with the simple steps below.

* [**Download Skype**](https://www.skype.com/) on your Mac system and sign in with your Microsoft account.
* On the home page of Skype, you need to press and open the drop-down menu right next to the “New Chat” notepad icon. From the list select the “New Group Chat” option to get started creating your Skype group chat.

![select new chat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-new-chat1.jpg)

* A new window will pop up for you to determine the group name and picture. Choose a name that best describes the purpose of the group, as in our case it’s a dummy chat group, so I named it “Skype group chat”. Once you’ve done press the forward arrow button.

![get group name](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-group-name2.jpg)

* You’ll be taken to your “Contact List” to choose the contacts you want to add to the group. After selecting all the contacts press the “Done” button and Skype will make a group chat and notify all the members of their joining the group.

![contact list](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/contact-list3.jpg)

## Part 4: Q&A about Skype Group Chat

Have some questions about skype group video chat? Keep the following!

### Q1: How many people can you have on a Skype group chat?

Skype group video chat enables up to 50 people to meet and cooperate all at once. The group screen sharing option allows the presenter to share PowerPoint slides, video recordings of the skype meeting, and much more. Making long-distance learning a possible reality for students all around the world and enabling remote co-workers to work on projects efficiently. Assign project modules and discuss due dates with more productive face-to-face conversations via Skype group video calling.

### Q2: Is it no longer possible to block individual contacts on Skype?

Skype enables you to block a contact to prevent them from sending you instant messages, calling you, and seeing your state on Skype, in effect blocking their access to your Skype profile. While the company also allows you to report the contact as abusive which can notify the company moderators to stop the spammers from an early stage and not allow them to torture other Skype users.

You can in effect block a contact in Skype

* 1\. Go to the “Recent Chats” or “Contacts” tab and select the contact you want to block.
* 2\. Right-click the contact name and chose the “View profile” option from the menu.
